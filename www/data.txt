The increasing complexity of software results in new challenges for<br>testing. Model Based Testing (MBT) continues to be an important research<br>area, where new approaches, methods and tools make MBT techniques more<br>deployable and useful for industry than ever. Models and different<br>abstractions can ease comprehension of a complex system and ease test<br>generation and automation. A-MOST has proven to be a successful workshop<br>that brings researchers and practitioners together discussing formal and<br>semi-formal approaches, specification formats and notations that<br>contribute to simplifying complex aspects of a system. The goal is to<br>bring researchers and practitioners together to discuss state of the<br>art, practice and future prospects in MBT.<br><br>Topics of interest:<br>-------------------<br>This conference would like to encourage the submission of original<br>papers that deal with any of the following topics, but not limited to:<br>1. The models used in MBT<br>2. The processes, techniques, and tools that support MBT<br>3. Evaluation (i.e., the evaluation of software using MBT and the<br>evaluation of MBT) Models<br>4. Models for component, integration and system testing<br>5. Product-line models & (Hybrid) embedded system models<br>6. Systems-of-systems models & Architectural models<br>7. Models for orchestration and choreography of services<br>8. Executable models and simulation<br>9. Environment and use models<br>10. Non-functional models and quantitative MBT<br>11.

IP particularly includes the<br>synthesis of programs that contain loops or recursive calls. This inductive<br>type of automated program synthesis is addressed by researchers in different<br>fields such as artificial intelligence, inductive logic programming,<br>evolutionary computation, symbolic computation, grammar inference, formal<br>methods, and functional programming. The aim of the AAIP workshop is to have a<br>common place to present and discuss research on all aspects of inductive<br>programming - including, but not limited to: Inductive programming algorithms,<br>techniques, and systems, heuristics, inductive biases, analysis of the<br>learnability of particular program classes, and the combination of<br>generate-and-test based and analytical techniques. We especially encourage<br>submissions on inductive programming challenge problems and real-world<br>applications of inductive programming in, e.g., computer-assisted software<br>engineering, end-user programming, and intelligent agents.<br><br>This is the fourth workshop on "Approaches and Applications of Inductive<br>Programming" and takes place for the first time in conjunction with PPDP and<br>LOPSTR.<br><br>We invite authors to submit papers reporting on original work in either of two<br>categories: full technical papers and short papers. Full papers should present<br>mature work. Short papers may be work in progress reports, descriptions of<br>system demonstrations, or position statements.<br><br>INVITED TALKS<br><br>TBA<br><br>PRESENTATION AND PUBLICATION INFORMATION<br><br>All accepted papers will be presented orally. Workshop (pre-)proceedings will<br>be published online and as a technical report.

(this is a copy of the call from the AAMAS website, feel free to update with the genuine one)<br><br><br>*** 13th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems ***<br><br>About AAMAS<br><br>AAMAS is the leading scientific conference for research in autonomous agents and multiagent systems. The AAMAS conference series was initiated in 2002 by merging three highly respected meetings: the International Conference on Multi-Agent Systems (ICMAS); the International Workshop on Agent Theories, Architectures, and Languages (ATAL); and the International Conference on Autonomous Agents (AA). The aim of the joint conference is to provide a single, high-profile, internationally respected archival forum for scientific research in the theory and practice of autonomous agents and multiagent systems.<br><br>AAMAS 2014, the thirteenth conference in the AAMAS series, seeks high-quality submissions of full papers, limited to 8 pages in length. Submissions will be rigorously peer reviewed and evaluated on the basis of originality, soundness, significance, presentation, understanding of the state of the art, and overall quality of their technical contribution. Reviews will be double blind; authors must avoid including anything that can be used to identify them. Please note that submitting an abstract is required to submit a full paper. However, the abstracts will not be reviewed and full (8 page) papers must be submitted for the review process to start. All work must be original, i.e., it must not have appeared in a conference proceedings, book, or journal. In addition to submissions in the main track, AAMAS 2014 will be soliciting papers in three special tracks. The review process for the special tracks will be similar to the main track, but with program committee members specially selected for that track. All accepted papers for the special tracks will be included in the proceedings.<br>Important dates<br><br>    Electronic Abstract Submission: October 8, 2013 (11:59 PM HST)<br>    Full Paper and Extended Abstract Submission: October 11, 2013 (11:59 PM HST)<br>    Rebuttal Phase: November 29 - December 2, 2013 (11:59 PM HST)<br>    Author Notification: December 20, 2013<br><br>* Topics of Interest<br>Agent Communication<br><br>    Agent commitments<br>    Communication languages and protocols<br>    Speech act theory<br><br>Agent Cooperation<br><br>    Biologically-inspired approaches and methods<br>    Collective intelligence<br>    Distributed problem solving<br>    Human-robot/agent interaction<br>    Multi-user/multi-virtual-agent interaction<br>    Teamwork, coalition formation, coordination<br>    Incentives for Cooperation<br>    Implicit Cooperation<br><br>Agent Cooperation<br><br>    Biologically-inspired approaches and methods<br>    Collective intelligence<br>    Distributed problem solving<br>    Human-robot/agent interaction<br>    Multi-user/multi-virtual-agent interaction<br>    Teamwork, coalition formation, coordination<br>    Incentives for Cooperation<br>    Multi-robot systems<br><br>Agent Reasoning<br><br>    Planning and Reasoning (single and multiagent)<br>    Cognitive models<br>    Knowledge representation<br>    Reasoning for robotic agents<br><br>Agent Societies and Societal issues<br><br>    Artificial social systems<br>    Environments, organizations and institutions<br>    Ethical and legal issues<br>    Privacy, safety and security<br>    Social and organizational structure<br>    Trust, reliability and reputation<br><br>Agent Theories and Models<br><br>    Logic-based agent theories<br>    Epistemic logic, cooperation logics<br>    Belief-Desire-Intention theories<br>    Belief revision and announcements<br>    Formal models of agency<br><br>Agent-based architectures<br><br>    service-oriented architectures<br>    mobile agents<br><br>Agent-based simulation<br><br>    Artificial societies<br>    Emergent behavior<br>    Simulation techniques, tools and environments<br>    Social simulation<br><br>Agent-based system development<br><br>    Agent development techniques, tools and environments<br>    Agent programming languages<br>    Agent specification or validation languages<br>    Design languages for agent systems<br>    Development environments<br>    P2P, web services, grid computing<br>    Software engineering (agent- or multi agent-oriented)<br>    security aspects of agent systems<br><br>Verification and Validation of agent-based systems<br><br>    Testing of agent-based systems, including model-based testing.<br>    Verification of agent-based systems, including model checking.<br>    Automatic synthesis of protocols.<br>    Fault tolerance and resilience.<br><br>Agreement Technologies<br><br>    Argumentation<br>    Collective decision making<br>    Negotiation<br>    Norms<br><br>Economic paradigm<br><br>    Electronic markets<br>    Economically-motivated agents<br>    Game Theory (cooperative and non-cooperative)<br>    Social choice theory<br>    Voting protocols<br>    Auction and mechanism design<br>    Bargaining and negotiation<br><br>Humans and Agents<br><br>    Human-robot/agent interaction<br>    Multi-user/multi-virtual-agent interaction<br>    Agents competing against humans<br>    Agent-based analysis of human interactions<br>    Agents for improving human cooperative activities<br><br>Learning and Adaptation<br><br>    Computational architectures for learning<br>    Reward structures for learning<br>    Evolution, adaptation<br>    Co-evolution<br>    Single agent Learning<br>    Multi-agent Learning<br><br>Systems and Organization<br><br>    Autonomic computing<br>    Complex systems<br>    Self-organization<br>    Novel agent and multiagent applications <br><br><br><br>In addition to the above, AAMAS 2014 will feature the following three special tracks.<br>Robotics (Chairs: Noa Agmon, Luiz Chaimowicz)<br><br>Papers that advance theory and applications of single and multiple robots are welcome, specifically those focusing on real robots that interact with their environment. Papers should clearly explain how the work addresses challenges in robotics, opportunities for novel applications, and fundamental research issues in autonomous robotic systems. The goal is to demonstrate the synergy achieved from integration of research in agents and robotics.<br><br>Virtual Agents (Chairs: Elisabeth André, Sarit Kraus)<br><br>Virtual agents are embodied agents that emulate autonomous human-like behavior in simulated interactive or physical environments. We encourage papers on the design, implementation, and evaluation of virtual agents as well as challenging applications featuring them. Of particular interest are papers addressing how humans interact with virtual agents. The goal is to provide an opportunity for continued interaction and cross-fertilization between the AAMAS community and researchers working on virtual agents and to strengthen links between the two communities.<br><br>Innovative Applications (Chairs: Tom Holvoet, Rajiv Maheswaran)<br><br>Due to the growing maturity of the field there are now agent-based applications in widespread use across many domains, responsible for the generation of significant revenues, or the saving of major costs, or for supporting important public policy and business strategy decision-making. This special track provides the ideal forum to present, discuss and demonstrate your compelling applications, agent system deployment experiences, and new business ideas. The goal is to promote the fostering of mutually-beneficial relationships between those doing foundational scientific research and those making autonomous agents and multi-agent systems a commercial or public policy reality.<br><br>General information<br><br>All full papers accepted to the main track and the special tracks will be presented in parallel technical sessions.

3rd International ABZ 2012 Conference <br>Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, VDM, Z <br><br>June 18-22, 2012 <br>CNR, Pisa, Italy <br>(in conjunction with IFM 2012) <br><br> <br>http://abzconference.org/<br>----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>IMPORTANT DATES<br>Workshop proposal submissions: October 15, 2011<br>Workshop proposal notifications: November 30, 2011<br>Paper submission:  January 14, 2012<br>Extended abstracts submission (for short presentations): February 3, 2012<br>Notification of acceptance/rejection: March 1, 2012<br>Final Version due: March 20, 2012<br>Tutorial proposal submissions: to be announced<br>Main ABZ 2012 conference: June 19-22, 2012<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>CONFERENCE CHAIRS  <br>For questions concerning ABZ 2012, contact:<br><br>Elvinia Riccobene, University of Milan, Italy (elvinia.riccobene@unimi.it) <br>Steve Reeves, University of Waikato, New Zealand (stever@cs.waikato.ac.nz).<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>RATIONALE <br><br>The ABZ 2012 conference is organized in Pisa (Italy) in<br>conjunction with iFM 2012 and is being held in honor of Prof.<br>Egon Börger's 65th birthday.<br><br>The ABZ conference is dedicated to the cross-fertilization of<br>five related state-based and machine-based formal methods,<br>Abstract State Machines (ASM), Alloy, B, VDM and Z,  that share<br>a common conceptual foundation and are widely used in both<br>academia and industry for the design and analysis of hardware<br>and software systems. It builds on the success of the first ABZ<br>conference held in London in 2008, where the ASM, B and Z<br>conference series merged into a single event, and the success of<br>the second ABZ conference held in Orford (Canada) where the<br>Alloy community joined the event. The novelty of the 3rd<br>international event is the inclusion of the VDM community in the<br>ABZ conference series.<br>      <br>Contributions are solicited on all aspects of the theory and<br>applications of ASMs, Alloy, B, VDM, Z and related approaches in<br>software/hardware engineering, including the development of<br>tools and industrial applications.  The program spans from<br>theoretical and methodological foundations to practical<br>applications, emphasizing system engineering methods and tools<br>that are distinguished by mathematical rigour and have proved to<br>be industrially viable. The main goal of the conference is to<br>contribute to the integration of accurate state- and<br>machine-based system development methods, clarifying their<br>commonalities and differences to better understand how to<br>combine different approaches for accomplishing the various tasks<br>in modeling, experimental validation, and mathematical<br>verification of reliable high-quality hardware/software systems. <br><br>Although organized logistically as a single, integral event,<br>editorial control of the joint conference remains vested in five<br>separate program committees, which will respectively determine<br>its ASM, Alloy, B, VDM and Z content, to be presented in<br>parallel conference tracks with a schedule to allow the<br>participants to switch between the sessions.  Proposals are<br>invited for workshops and tutorials to take place the day before<br>the main conference. <br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------<br><br>SUBMISSION POLICY, INSTRUCTIONS, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS <br><br>Two kinds of contributions are invited:<br><br>* Research papers: full papers of not more than 14 pages in LNCS<br>format, which have to be original, unpublished and not<br>submitted elsewhere. <br><br>* Short presentations of work in progress, industrial experience<br>reports and tool demonstrations. This is an excellent<br>opportunity for Ph.D. students to present and validate their<br>work in progress. It is also an interesting option for<br>industrial practitioners who sometimes face too many constraints<br>to prepare a full paper. An extended abstract of not more than 4<br>pages is expected and will be reviewed. A volume of accepted<br>extended abstracts will be made available as a Technical Report<br>with an ISBN number, and a 1-page abstract of each presentation<br>will be published in the Proceedings.<br><br>Contributions should be submitted electronically in PDF at the<br>ABZ 2012 conference Easy-Chair web site<br>https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=abz2012<br>The papers must be prepared using the SPRINGER LNCS style<br>http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0<br><br>All accepted papers will be published in a volume of Springer's<br>LNCS series. The LNCS volume of the Conference Proceedings will<br>be distributed at the conference.

Open systems consist of<br>multiple autonomous and heterogeneous agents who communicate in order<br>to exchange or negotiate information, knowledge, and services.  As<br>such, advances in agent communication are critical to advances in the<br>software engineering of applications as diverse as business processes,<br>negotiation and argumentation, virtual organizations, e-governance,<br>collaborative design, and so on.<br><br>We invite quality submissions that develop new insights, high-level<br>abstractions, patterns, languages, formal theories, reasoning, and<br>methodologies for agent communication.  We will also appreciate<br>submissions concerning experiences in application development,<br>programming language and tool support, and communication middleware.<br>Proposals for standardization are also welcome.<br><br>Specifically, the workshop's focus includes the following topics in<br>relation to agent communication.<br><br>* Languages (ACLs)<br>* Protocols<br>* Dialogs <br>* Argumentation<br>* Virtual organizations, institutions<br>* Commitments, norms, and other social concepts<br>* Speech acts and illocutionary logic<br>* Trust and deception<br>* Correctness properties and verification<br>  ** compliance, <br>  ** interoperability, <br>  ** conformance, and so on.<br>* Relating agent communication to agent design and execution strategies <br>  ** game-theoretic, <br>  ** BDI, <br>  ** learning, and so on<br>* Multiagent system architecture <br>* Programming languages <br>* Middleware <br>* Patterns<br><br>The workshop will provide a great opportunity to discuss emerging<br>techniques and identify future trends toward agent communication.  The<br>workshop will include an invited talk and one or more position<br>statements by accomplished researchers. Selected papers from the<br>workshop proceedings will be published as a Springer LNCS volume.<br><br>Program committee (confirmed, but partial):<br><br>Nicoletta Fornara, Universit? della Svizzera Italiana, Switzerland<br>Marco Colombetti, Politecnico di Milano, Italy<br>Pinar Yolum, Bogazici University, Turkey<br>Marc-Philippe Huget, University of Savoie, France<br>Wamberto Vasconcelos, University of Aberdeen, UK<br>Koen Hindriks, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands<br>Michael Rovatsos, University of Edinburgh, UK<br>Rogier van Eijk, Utrecht University, The Netherlands<br>Xavier Parent, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg<br>Peter McBurney, University of Liverpool, UK<br>Guido Boella, University of Torino, Italy<br>Paolo Torroni, University of Bologna, Italy<br>Michael N.

CALL FOR PAPERS<br><br>SPONSORS<br><br>Sponsored by ICST<br>Technically co-sponsored by CREATE-NET<br><br>***<br><br>SCOPE<br><br>With the rapid growth of the Internet as well as the increasing demand for broadband services, access networks have been receiving growing investments in recent years. This has led to a massive network deployment with the goal of eliminating the bandwidth bottleneck between end-users and the network core. Today many diverse technologies are being used to provide broadband access to end users. The architecture and performance of the access segment (local loop, wired and wireless access networks, and even home networks) are getting increasing attention for ensuring quality of service of diverse broadband applications. Moreover, most access lines will no longer terminate on a single device, thus leading to the necessity of having a home network designed for applications that transcend simple Internet access sharing among multiple personal computers and enable multimedia support. Therefore, the access network and its home portion have become a hot investment pool from both a financial as well as a research perspective.<br><br>The aim of the annual International Conference on Access Networks (ACCESSNETS) is to provide a forum that brings together scientists and researchers from academia, as well as managers and engineers from the industry and government organizations to meet and exchange ideas and recent work on all aspects of access networks and how they integrate with their in-home counterparts. ACCESSNETS 2010 is the fifth edition of this exciting event, which will be held in Budapest, Hungary, on 3-5 November 2010. The conference will consist of technical sessions, industry track, workshops and panels. The technical sessions will present original and fundamental research advances while the industry track, workshops and panels will focus on development, application and related business issues in this hot and exciting area.<br><br>***<br><br>TOPICS<br><br>The conference solicits original technical papers that were not previously published and are not currently under review for publication elsewhere.

We hope to receive many excellent papers dealing practically as well as theoretically with this theme, inspired by John Seely Brown’s lecture on “tinkering as a mode of knowledge construction”, by the fact that making games and toys is often even more fun than playing with them, and by the very hands-on creative approach with which ACE participants have always explored the boundaries of creative technology. <br><br>==== THE CONFERENCE ====<br><br>ACE has become the leading scientific forum for dissemination of cutting-edge research results in the area of entertainment computing. Interactive entertainment is one of the most vibrant areas of interest in modern society and is amongst the fastest growing industries in the world. ACE 2013 will bring together leading researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative work and discuss all aspects and challenges of interactive entertainment technology, in an exciting, cultural, and stimulating environment.<br><br>ACE is by nature a multi-disciplinary conference, therefore attracting people across a wide spectrum of interests and disciplines including computer science, design, arts, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and marketing. The main goal of ACE is to stimulate discussion in the development of new and compelling entertainment computing and interactive art concepts and applications. All ACE participants are encouraged to present work they believe will shape the future, going beyond the established paradigms, and focusing on all areas related to interactive entertainment.<br><br>== TYPES OF SUBMISSION ====<br><br>We invite paper submissions in various tracks: regular papers for the main track, special sessions, poster papers, interactive art and creative showcases. Accepted submissions in these tracks will be published with a major publisher. In addition, we invite proposals for workshops and kids’ workshops, and submissions to the ACE 2013 Game Competition.<br><br>==== TOPICS ====<br><br>In addition to this year’s theme, we solicit submissions on a broad range of topics, including, but not limited to: Aesthetics; Affective Computing; Animation Techniques; Augmented, Mixed and Virtual Reality; Avatars and Autonomous Characters; Children-Computer Interaction; Cultural Computing; Cultural Differences and Game Design; Digital Broadcasting/Podcasting; Educational and Fitness Games; Emerging World Entertainment Creation; Entertainment Design Theory; Ethics and Games; Exertion Games; Interaction and Experience Design; Funology; Game Design, Programming and Production; Human-Robot Interaction; Interactive Art; Location-Based Entertainment; Mobile and Ubiquitous Entertainment; Museum and Cultural Heritage Applications; Interactive Storytelling; Persuasive Entertainment; Pervasive and Online Games; Serious Games for Cultural Awareness; Smart Gadgets and Toys; Social Impact; Sound and Music Design; Tangible Interfaces; Tinkering and Tinker-based Learning; Urban Games; Usability and Playability; User-Centred Design; Visual Arts; Youth Usage of Entertainment<br><br>==== SUBMISSION DETAILS ====<br><br>To encourage presentation of such multi-disciplinary work, we invite paper submissions that fall into the following tracks.

The fifth biannual Humaine Association Conference on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction (ACII 2013) will be held in Geneva, Switzerland on September 2-5, 2013.<br><br>The Conference series on Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction is the premier international forum for research on affective and multimodal human-machine interaction and systems. <br><br>This ACII edition will emphasize the humanistic side of affective computing by promoting publications at the cross-road between engineering and human sciences (including biological, social and cultural aspects of human life).<br><br>The ACII conference will be organized by the Computer Vision and Multimedia Laboratory and the Swiss Center for Affective Sciences from the University of Geneva. Geneva has one of Europe's most beautiful sceneries, situated between a lake and mountains and is a highly international city where English speaking is common. It has been a cultural center for many centuries and home to many creative spirits in the fields of science and art.<br><br>The conference will address, but is not limited to, the following topics:<br>.    Computational and psychological models of emotion;<br>.    Affect in arts, entertainment and multimedia (literature, texts, music, movies, games, interactive art);<br>.    Bodily manifestations of affect (facial expressions, body movements, behavior, physiology, multimodal studies);<br>.    Databases for emotion processing, development and issues;<br>.    Affective interfaces and applications (games, learning, dialogue systems.);<br>.    Ecological and continuous emotion assessment;<br>.    Affect in social interactions.<br><br><br>Submission Instructions<br>-----------------------<br><br>Regular Papers:<br>The papers should feature original work (i.e., not submitted to another conference or journal while in review by ACII). ACII 2013 proceedings will be published by a major publisher. Previous proceedings appeared in IEEE Xplore (2009) and in the Springer Lecture Notes series (2011). Details about the submission instructions, length, and format will appear on the ACII 2013 website soon. Authors of a selected subset of accepted papers will be invited to publish expanded versions in one or two journals. Two journals have already agreed to publish such subsets. <br><br>Doctoral Consortium:<br>The Doctoral Consortium (DC) serves as forum for PhD students to share ideas about the theories behind affective computing, its development, and its application. Submissions should describe PhD research that is at a stage where feedback from the international community might be of value. DC Submissions will be reviewed, and accepted contributions are published in the conference proceedings. The Prof Fiorella de Rosis award will be presented to the best DC paper. Details about the Doctoral Consortium and submission are communicated in a separate CFP and will appear on the ACII 2013 website soon.<br><br>Interactive Events (Demos):<br>The ACII 2013 Interactive Events (Demos) Session is the ideal forum for researchers and practitioners to showcase recent advances in affective computing. The session will feature live demonstration of both mature systems and prototypes, and the presenters will have the opportunity to discuss their systems with the broader international scientific community and the public at large. Two-page Interactive Event extended abstracts  will be published in the Conference Proceedings. Details about the Interactive Events (Demos) and proposal submission are communicated in a separate CFP and will appear on the ACII 2013 website soon.<br><br>Optional Public Event:<br>Currently we are investigating the possibility to also showcase work in affective computing as part of a major public exhibition event. We actively seak ideas for such material. Details about submitting proposals for this public event can be found in a separate CFP and will appear on the ACII 2013 website soon.<br><br><br>Workshops:<br>Workshops at ACII aim to facilitate lively discussions, comparison of methods, and synthesis of results on particular topics of interest to Affective Computing. We invite workshop proposals on any current or emerging topic of relevance to Affective Computing and Intelligent Interaction.

Third International Workshop on <br>Active Conceptual Modeling of Learning<br>ACM-L 2010<br><br>Vancouver, BC, Canada, 1-4 November 2010<br>[to be held in conjunction with the 29th International Conference on<br>Conceptual Modeling, ER 2010]<br><br>http://www.er2010.sauder.ubc.ca/ <br><br>http://www.cs.uta.fi/conferences/acm-l-2010/<br><br><br>Workshop Description and Call for Papers<br><br>We will study a framework for the active conceptual modeling of learning based on the <br>Entity-Relationship (ER) approach and human cognition paradigm for developing a learning- <br>base to support and develop complex applications, act on inevitable "surprises" and cognitive <br>capability development. The goal is to develop new technology for building computer <br>systems that help us learn from the past, cope with the present and plan for the future. <br><br>A need for active conceptual modeling for information systems rises from several sources: <br>active modeling, emergency management, learning from surprises, data provenance, <br>modification of the events/conditions/actions as the system evolves, actively evolving <br>conceptual models, schema changes in conceptual models, historical information in <br>conceptual models, ontological modeling in domain-aware systems, spatio-temporal and <br>multi-representation modeling, etc. The most important needs are perhaps emergency <br>management and learning from surprises, because they often appear in big disasters and <br>catastrophes. In these kinds of situations, information systems must collect large amounts raw <br>data, analyze it, conceptualize it, map it to the domain, distribute it, make conclusions, make <br>plans for new activities, and manage cooperation of active officials. <br><br>This effort aims to enhance our fundamental understanding of how to capture knowledge <br>from transitions between system states, model continual learning from past experiences, and <br>construct new interpretations on the basis of evolution of recognized system states. <br><br>Problem: The advent of information technology allows us to model the world by mapping <br>real-world scenarios onto information systems and applications in a more sophisticated way. <br>However, today's databases and knowledge bases only reflect the static characteristics of the <br>intended Universe of Discourse, captured by the conceptual model as distinct snapshots.  The <br>information system, which provides us with "almost recent" information, neither supports <br>applications that require historical information nor provides information for projecting the <br>future based on past experience and lessons learned. Without the relationships between <br>snapshots, it is difficult to simulate the "what if" scenarios.  Temporal and spatial <br>relationships between entity behaviors and uncertainty cannot be fully modeled. Temporal <br>concepts are not taken into account properly. Therefore, historical information and their <br>changes cannot be managed, and the certainty of information cannot be assessed. Inadequate <br>dynamic modeling constructs result in incomplete representation of the changing real-world <br>domain.   <br><br>Approach: To achieve active information processing, learning from our past experience is <br>essential. Learning is a continuous process by which relatively permanent behavioral changes <br>occur, potentially as a result of an experience. Lessons learned are knowledge gained by <br>reflecting on experiences that can avoid the repetitions of past mishaps to share observations <br>and to improve future actions. While learning is an ongoing process that transfers knowledge <br>from one state to another, a lesson learned summarizes knowledge at a point in time. To <br>describe an experience is to model past events and associated knowledge from a different <br>perspective. The domain can be described in terms of topic, time/space, people, <br>scenarios/events, cause/effect and general knowledge about the situation or domain. Active <br>conceptual modeling is a continual process of describing all concepts and aspects of a domain, <br>its activities, and changes under different perspectives. The model is viewed as a multilevel <br>(e.g. strategic, tactical, operational) and multi-perspective high-level abstraction of reality. <br>Our effort focuses on relationships between past knowledge/data and current knowledge/data <br>from different perspectives. We propose a framework for active conceptual modeling of <br>learning.<br><br>Topics:<br><br>Technical Areas: Accomplishing our goal will require investigation of the following basic and <br>exploratory research areas. Some other relevant areas may also be found.<br>? Integrating time, space, and perspective dimensions in a theoretical framework of conceptual <br>models <br>	- Theory of human concepts, human cognition<br>	- ER theory <br>	- Mathematical active conceptual models <br>	- Multi-level conceptual modeling <br>	- Multi-perspective conceptual modeling <br>	- Multi-media information modeling <br>	- Mapping of constructs among conceptual models <br><br>? Management of continuous changes and learning <br>	- Conceptual change<br>	- Continuous knowledge acquisition <br>	- Experience modeling and management <br>	- Learning from experience <br>	- Representation and management of changes <br>	- Transfer learning in time dimension <br>	- Lessons learned capturing <br>	- Information extraction, discovery, and summarization <br><br>? Behaviors of evolving systems ? including model evolution, patterns, interpretation, <br>uncertainty, integration <br>	- Time and events in evolving systems <br>	- Situation monitoring (system- and user-level)  <br>	- Schema evolution and version management <br>	- Content awareness and context awareness <br>	- Modeling of context changes <br>	- Information integration and interpretation <br>	- Pattern recognition over a time period <br>	- Uncertainty management WRT integrity <br>	- Reactive, proactive, adaptive, deductive capability in support of active behavior <br>	- Combined episodic and semantic memory paradigm for structuring of historical <br>information <br><br>? Executable conceptual models for implementation of active systems <br>	- Dynamic reserve modeling <br>	- Storage management <br>	- Security  <br>	- User interface <br>	- Bench marking for Test & Evaluation <br>	- Languages for information manipulation <br>	- Architectures for information system based on the active conceptual model  <br><br>Capability: The active model can only be realized by integrating technology (e.g. AI, software <br>engineering, information/knowledge management, cognitive science, philosophy, etc.) and <br>combining <br>modeling techniques. We will provide an enhanced situational awareness and monitoring <br>capability <br>through the following services ( See more:  http://www.cs.uta.fi/conferences/acm-l-2010/): <br><br>Applications:  The ACM-L capability can be applied to a large class of applications including <br>the <br>following ( See more:  http://www.cs.uta.fi/conferences/acm-l-2010/): <br><br>Status: To begin framing the problem, SPAWARSYSCEN Pacific hosted two workshops on <br>ACM-L in 2006.

Santorini Island, Greece
Mar 19, 2012
%%
Cellular automata (CA) present a very powerful approach to the study of spatio-temporal systems where complex phenomena build up out of many simple local interactions.<br><br>They account often for real phenomena or solutions of problems, whose high complexity could unlikely be formalised in different contexts.<br><br>Furthermore parallelism and locality features of CA allow a straightforward and extremely easy parallelisation, therefore an immediate implementation on parallel computing resources. These characteristics of the CA research resulted in the formation of interdisciplinary research teams.<br><br>These teams produce remarkable research results and attract scientists from different fields. The main goal of the 10th edition of ACRI 2012 Conference (Cellular Automata for Research and Industry) is to offer both scientists and engineers in academies and industries an opportunity to express and discuss their views on current trends, challenges, and state-of-the art solutions to various problems in the fields of arts, biology, chemistry, communication, cultural heritage, ecology, economy, geology, engineering, medicine, physics, sociology, traffic control, etc.<br><br>Topics of either theoretical or applied interest about CA and CA-based models and systems include but are not limited to:<br><br>    Algebraic properties and generalization<br>    Complex systems<br>    Computational complexity<br>    Dynamical systems<br>    Hardware circuits, architectures, systems and applications<br>    Modeling of biological systems<br>    Modeling of physical or chemical systems<br>    Modeling of ecological and environmental systems<br>    Image Processing and pattern recognition<br>    Natural Computing Quantum Cellular Automata<br>    Parallelism<br><br>This edition of the ACRI conference also hosts workshops on recent and important research topics on theory and applications of Cellular Automata like the following: Crowds and Cellular Automata (3rd edition), Asynchronicity and Traffic and Cellular Automata.

The 29th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) will be held the week of December 9-13, 2013, in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA. In its beginning, ACSAC focused on protecting information in aerospace applications but has since expanded to cover the explosion of very specialized topics in cyber security. One side effect is that it has become more challenging to examine multi-dimensioned problems and to gather the perspectives necessary to yield practical solutions for these problems.<br><br>For 2013, ACSAC will renew its focus on hard, cutting-edge, cyber security problems requiring cooperation from government, industry and academia by organizing a track of orchestrated sessions for each problem. These sessions will include invited speakers to frame the problem, discuss issues related to the problem, discuss solutions that show promise, and present useful lessons learned. The orchestrated track may be complemented by contributed peer-reviewed papers, workshops, panels, and training sessions that are related to the problem.<br><br>A Call for Ideas<br><br>The ACSAC organizing committee is working now to identify the hard problems to highlight in 2013. We seek a description of the problem (up to one page) and suggestions for speakers representing government, industry and/or academia, to frame the problem and present solutions, issues, and lessons learned. We also seek suggestions for workshops, working groups, and training sessions that provide necessary background and a forum to discuss solutions. By February 1, 2013, please communicate your ideas for hard problems, including the description and speaker suggestions, by email to (Program_Chair@acsac.org). Selected problems will be announced on our website by March 1, 2013.<br><br>A Call for Contributed Works<br><br>ACSAC continues to be interested in peer-reviewed papers and panels in all aspects of cyber security. We encourage submissions that describe practical application and lessons learned, especially submissions related to the selected hard problems. More details will be provided in the Call for Papers to be released later. We expect submissions to close around June 1, 2013.<br><br>Please continue to follow http://www.acsac.org for more details as they emerge, and we look forward to seeing you in New Orleans!<br><br>The ACSAC 2013 Organizing Committee

The symposium emphasises both commercial and academic issues by encouraging a variety of submissions.<br><br>Topics of interest<br><br>The symposium topics include (but are not restricted to) the following:<br>Cognitive Aspects of Documents<br>Digital Libraries<br>Document Databases<br>Document Management<br>Document Standards (XML, SGML, etc.)<br>Document Workflow<br>Information Retrieval<br>Multimedia Document Management<br>Multimedia Resource Discovery<br>Natural Language Techniques and Documents<br>Personalised Documents<br>User Studies Involving Documents<br>Web Documents<br><br>Submissions<br><br>All submissions must be original work, not previously published elsewhere, and not currently submitted to any other conference or journal. Electronic copies of accepted papers will be made available through the ACM Digital Library. Manuscripts should be submitted electronically, in PDF format and formatted using the ACM camera-ready templates available at: http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates. Full papers have a maximum of length of 8 pages including all references, and short papers have a maximum length of 4 pages including references. All submissions will be fully refereed using a single blind refereeing process, at their full published length, and will comply with DEST criteria for fully-refereed conference papers (category F1). Papers will be submitted using Easy Chair. See Submissions for more information.<br>Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the symposium to present the work. Note also that it is insufficient for an author to register and pay for the symposium to be regarded as fulfilling this obligation.<br><br>Full papers<br><br>Full papers should describe new contributions or analyse research issues. Submissions should be at most eight pages long (around 4000 words); over-length submissions risk immediate rejection. Refer to the guidelines for papers for details of the required format.<br><br>Posters, short papers and industry status reports<br><br>To encourage participation by industry and to provide a place for work of a more speculative nature, ADCS invites submissions for short papers, up to a maximum of four pages (around 2000 words). A typical proposal might describe a leading-edge solution to a practical problem in document management. Short papers follow the same format as for full papers.

CALL FOR PAPERS<br><br>=============================================================<br><br>ADT 2013<br><br>Third International Conference on ALGORITHMIC DECISION THEORY<br><br>Brussels, Nov. 13-15, 2013<br><br>www.adt2013.org<br><br>==============================================================<br><br>The International Research Group on Algorithmic Decision Theory in collaboration with the European working group on preferences is proud to announce the Third International Conference on Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT 2013). ADT seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners coming from diverse areas such as Artificial Intelligence, Database Systems, Operations Research, Decision Theory, Discrete Mathematics, Game Theory, Multiagent systems, Computational Social Choice, and Theoretical Computer Science in order to improve the theory and practice of modern decision support and automation systems. The contemporary theory and practice of decision theory and decision analysis must account for the presence of massive databases containing data extracted from the web or via data mining, combinatorial structures, partial and/or uncertain information, and distributed, possibly interoperating decision makers, and the existence of masses of potential users on the web. Such problems arise in various real-world decision making problems such as electronic commerce, and recommender systems, network optimization (communication, transport, energy), risk assessment and management, e-government.<br><br>ADT provides a multi-disciplinary forum for sharing knowledge in this area with a special focus on algorithmic issues in Decision Theory. The two first International Conference on Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT 2009, 2011) brought together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas of computer science, economics, and operations research from around the globe, with proceedings published in LNAI 5783 and LNAI 6992. ADT 2013 seeks to continue this tradition and invites technical research papers on the following areas:<br><br>- Algorithmic Challenges to Modern Decision Support and Automation<br>- Uncertainty and Robustness in Decision Making<br>- Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis and optimization<br>- Collective Decision Making<br>- Preferences in Reasoning and Decision Making<br>- Decision Theoretic Artificial Intelligence<br>- Learning and Knowledge Extraction for Decision Support<br><br>More specifically contributions to the conference are sought in the following topics: Preference Modeling and Aggregation; Multiobjective optimization; Planning and Sequential Decision Making under uncertainty; Robustness in Decision Making; Computational Social Choice; Compact Representation of Preferences; Preference Elicitation, Queries in Data Bases; Universal Languages for Preferences; Efficient Algorithms for Decision Making and Support; Multi-Agent Systems; Algorithmic Game Theory ; Communication Complexity; Argumentation and Explanation in Decision Support; Preferences and Policies Learning; Knowledge Extraction; Algorithm Tuning; Recommender Systems; Decision Support Systems.<br><br>The ADT 2013 Program Committee invites submissions of technical research papers that will be reviewed based on the standard criteria of clarity, relevance, significance, originality, and soundness. These papers are expected to convey substantial technical contributions to the field, or to describe case studies and deployed applications, all placed in the context of existing work.<br><br>Important dates:<br>-----------------<br>Title and abstract submission: May 3, 2013;<br>Paper submission: May 12, 2013;<br>Notification: June 7, 2011;<br>Final version June 28, 2013;<br>ADT'13: November 13-15, 2013;<br><br>Submission Details:<br>-------------------<br>Two types of submission are proposed:<br><br>- Submission for proceedings: Submissions are invited on significant, original, and previously unpublished research on all aspects of Algorithmic Decision Theory. Papers must be at most 12 pages long in the LNCS format. The proceedings of ADT 2013 will be published by Springer Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series. Papers will be accepted for either oral or poster presentation, or both. However, no distinction will be made between accepted papers in the conference proceedings.<br><br>- Submission without proceedings: Submission are invited on significant recent results on Algorithmic Decision Theory. Papers must be at most 12 pages long. They will not appear in the proceedings and can be submitted elsewhere. Selected papers in this category will be accepted for either oral or poster presentation, or both.<br><br>In any case, at least one author of each accepted paper is required to attend the conference to present the work. Authors will be required to agree to this  requirement at the time of submission. Papers must be submitted via the Easychair system (see the conference web page www.adt2013.org for details).<br><br>Location:<br>---------<br>Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.<br><br>Organization Committee:<br>----------------------<br>Marc Pirlot (U. of Mons), Yves De Smet (U. Libre of Brussels), Patrice Perny (U. of Pierre et Marie Curie, PC Chair), Alexis Tsoukiàs (CNRS, U. Paris Dauphine),  Paolo Viappiani (CNRS, U. of Pierre et Marie Curie).<br>

AFRICACRYPT 2009<br>June 21-25, 2009, Gammarth, Tunisia<br><br>Submission: January 6, 2009<br>Poster Submission: February 2, 2009<br>Notification (for papers and posters): March 5, 2009<br>Final Version: March 30, 2009<br><br>General Information<br><br>Original papers on all technical aspects of cryptology are solicited for submission to Africacrypt 2009. The conference is organized by the Tunisian National Digital Certification Agency in cooperation with IACR. For more information see http://www.africacrypt2009.tn/.<br>The conference seeks original contributions in any area of cryptology or related fields. We welcome submissions about new cryptographic primitive proposals, cryptanalysis, security models, hardware<br>and software implementation aspects, cryptographic protocols and applications. We also consider submissions about cryptographic aspects of network security, complexity theory, information theory, coding theory, number theory, and quantum computing.<br><br>Instructions for Authors of Papers<br><br>Submissions must not substantially duplicate work that any of the authors has published elsewhere or has submitted in parallel to any other conference or workshop with formally published proceedings. Information about submissions may be shared with program chairs of other conferences for that purpose. Accepted submissions may not appear in any other conference or workshop with proceedings. The submission must be anonymous, with no author names, affiliations, acknowledgments, or obvious references. It should begin with a title, a short abstract, and a list of key words, and its introduction should summarize the contributions of the paper at a level appropriate for a non-specialist reader. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits.<br>Since the final version of accepted papers will have to follow the LNCS guidelines (see http://www.springeronline.com/lncs) with a total page limit of 18 pages including references and appendices, it is mandatory to submit in the same format. Up to 12 pages of additional supporting information may be provided, but committee members will read this information at their discretion, so the paper should be intelligible and self-contained within the 18 page LNCS limit.<br><br>Papers must be submitted electronically. A detailed description of the electronic submission procedure will be made available at the conference website. Submissions must conform to this procedure. Late submissions and non-electronic submissions will not be considered.<br>Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the conference.<br><br>It is the intention that accepted papers will be published in Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in Computer Science and will be available at the conference. Instructions about the preparation of a final proceedings version will be sent to the authors of accepted papers.<br><br>Instructions for Authors of Posters<br><br>In addition to the mainstream session, Africacrypt 2009 will have a poster session.<br>Authors who want to present a poster are encouraged to send an anonymous article of 4 to 10 pages in<br>LNCS format (and without supporting information). This limit will be strictly enforced. A printout of abstracts of the posters will be made available to the conference participants. Authors of accepted abstracts for the poster session must guarantee that they will have a poster presenting the technical content of their abstract available for presentation at the conference poster session. Posters will not appear in the LNCS proceedings.<br><br>Program Committee<br><br>Michel Abdalla, ENS, Paris, France<br>Paulo Barreto, University of Sao Paulo (USP), Brazil<br>Tom Berson, Anagram, USA<br>Anne Canteaut, INRIA Paris-Rocquencourt, France<br>Dario Catalano, University of Catania, Italy<br>Herve Chabanne, SAGEM, France<br>Jean-Marc Couveignes, Université Toulouse 2, France<br>Kris Gaj, George Mason University, USA<br>Henri Gilbert, Orange Labs, France<br>Helena Handschuh, Spansion, France<br>Martin Hirt, ETH Zurich, Switzerland<br>Seokhie Hong, Korea University, Korea<br>Tetsu Iwata, Nagoya University, Japan<br>Yassine Lakhnech, University Joseph Fourier-Grenoble, France<br>Tanja Lange, T.U.Eindhoven, The Netherlands<br>Yiqun Lisa Lin, USA<br>Helger Lipmaa, Cybernetica AS, Estonia<br>Keith Martin, Royal Holloway University of London, UK<br>Mitsuru Matsui, Mitsubishi Electric, Japan<br>Sihem Mesnager, University of Paris 8, France<br>Kaisa Nyberg, Helsinki University of Technology and Nokia, Finland<br>Sami Omar, University of Tunis, Tunisia<br>Elisabeth Oswald, University of Bristol, UK<br>Bart Preneel (chair), K.U.Leuven, Belgium<br>Alexander May, R.U.Bochum, Germany<br>Rei Safavi-Naini, University of Calgary, Canada<br>Kazue Sako, NEC, Japan<br>Ali Aydin Selcuk, Bilkent University, Turkey<br>Christine Swart, University of Cape Town, South Africa<br>Serge Vaudenay, EPFL, Switzerland<br>Frederik Vercauteren, K.U.Leuven, Belgium<br>Michael Wiener, Cryptographic Clarity, Canada<br><br>Conference chairs :<br><br>Program Chair:<br>Bart Preneel<br>Katholieke Universiteit Leuven<br>Dept.

Potential contributors are invited to submit :<br><br>Full-paper submission (Papers mustn't exceed 6000 words and 17 pages) of original and unpublished fundamental scientific research. High-quality scientific submissions will be accepted for presentation at the conference and published in the Springer Lecture Notes on Geoinformation and Cartography. We especially encourage PhD students to submit full papers. Papers must be written in English according to the Springer formatting guidelines. Please remind that your submitted paper must be anonymous (double blind reviewing process). You must drop the author(s) names and all information which could be used to easily retrieve them.<br>Note: The first anonymous version of the full papers must be submitted in PDF. The final version of accepted full papers included in the Springer Special issue must be provided in .DOC or .DOCX formats based on the Springer Word Document Template. A best practive example showing how to format a full paper submission is provided here. A similar process will be applied on short papers selection, in a second stage, after the selection of the full papers.<br><br>Note: AGILE 2012 is running a blind review process. In preparing your manuscript, do not include any information which could reveal your identity, or that of your co-authors. The title section of your manuscript should not contain any author names, email addresses, or affiliation status. In the body of your submission, you should eliminate all direct references to your own previous work. That is, avoid phrases such as "this contribution generalizes our results for XYZ". Also, please do not disproportionately cite your own previous work. In other words, make your submission as anonymous as possible. We need your cooperation in our effort to maintain a fair, blind reviewing process.<br>Short paper submission (2000 to 3000-word manuscript) of original and unpublished research work. High-quality scientific and strategic (industrial and governmental) submissions will be accepted for presentation at the conference. Papers must be written in English according to the submission template and formatting guidelines.<br><br>Poster submission (500 to 1000-word manuscript) of original scientific and strategic research work. High-quality submissions will be accepted for poster presentations at the conference and provide the exceptional opportunity to stimulate scientific discussions and exchange novel ideas.

4th International Workshop on Automated Media Analisys and Production for Novel TV Services (AIEMPro11)<br>(http://aiempro2011.inria.fr/index.html)<br><br>In conjunction with ACM Multimedia 2011 (http://www.acmmm11.org/index.html) , Scottsdale, Arizona<br>28 Nov. - Dec. 1 2011<br><br>Organised By:<br>- RAI Radiotelevisione Italiana, Centre for Research and Technological Innovation, Italy<br>- France Telecom Orange Labs, France<br>- Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep - Medialab, Belgium<br>- European Broadcasting Union . Union Européenne de Radiotélévision, Switzerland<br>- NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation) Science and Technology Research Laboratories, Japan<br>- International Computer Science Institute, USA<br>- INRIA, France<br>- National Institute of Informatics, Japan<br><br>Call for papers <br>The explosive growth of new media distribution channels in the Internet and the resulting new production workflows based on computerized tools are forcing media industry to adapt new business models and supporting technologies. <br><br>The Fourth Workshop on Automated Media Analysis and Production for Novel TV Services (AIEMPro 2011) aims at fostering the exchange of ideas and best practices between leading experts in industrial and academic research, academic stakeholders of prospective methods, and leading actors in the media industry.<br><br>The workshop aims to catalyze the migration towards new ways of producing, broadcasting, and presenting media content, via the introduction of tools for automated multimedia analysis and understanding. At the same time, the workshop will help academic researchers better understand the real-life key requirements that enable higher impact and wider adoption of these methods.<br><br>Media production workflows are substantially influenced by new ways of acquiring, elaborating, and publishing audiovisual material, as well as by bandwidth adaptive streaming through Internet portals. In this context, automatic information extraction techniques based on audiovisual content analysis are seen as an interesting and promising option to streamline these processes and lower the total cost of new productions, and as a way to help to disseminate existing archives. This line of development has been fully recognized by the European Broadcasting Union, Time Warner, and other major players in industry. However, so far the potential of these methods is yet to be leveraged in everyday use.<br><br>On the delivery side, TV content is generally available as continuous streams of audio-visual frames. For example, in linear television, useful TV programs and inter-programs (like commercials, trailers) are concatenated and broadcasted without any precise and reliable flags that identify the boundaries and times of interest. Thus, media streams have to be first macro-segmented and segments must be classified and mined with the objective to recover the original structure of the stream. <br><br>In general, programs need to be described, structured, summarized, classified following their genre and theme, indexed, stored and retrieved. Events of interest also need to be detected in programs. Events may concern for instance goals and important actions in football footage, but also each time a specific person appears on screen. Automatically understanding program storylines is also an important issue when creating summaries. It also provides high-level metadata that improves the effectiveness of the search.<br><br>At previous editions of this workshop (AIEMPro 2010 and CBTV 2009 ), work showing important progress in several steps of the media production process has been presented. But there are still many challenges ahead for leveraging the application these promising research results in production processes, e.g., generalization across content types, formats and genres, adaptation to requirements in different sub-processes, reliable evaluation methods assessing the fitness of a method for a certain purpose and novel intuitive user interfaces.<br><br>The workshop aims at attracting the attention of researchers and practitioners in the field of automatic information extraction based on audiovisual content analysis on the problems related with media production processes. In particular, the objective is to analyze the impact and performances of these tools in real-life applications, and on real-life material.<br><br>Authors are encouraged to submit papers on which they enlighten the features of existing or novel systems and applications in the key aspects of future media production based on automated information extraction. This includes acquisition, editing, search and retrieval, publishing, archiving and repurposing of audiovisual material.<br><br>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: <br><br>•Multimodal topic and concept detection, categorization, and genre / editorial format detection<br>•Automatic speech recognition and keyword spotting <br>•Automated copyright infringement detection and watermarking<br>•Duplicate and near duplicate detection<br>•Content segmentation (video and/or audio)<br>•Content summarization <br>•High- and low-level acoustic, visual, and multimodal indexing <br>•Multimodal personality identification (e.g., combined face and speaker identification) <br>•Visual and acoustic event detection in multimedia streams<br>•Thematic and semantic clustering of television programmes<br>•(Semi-) Automated repurposing of archived material <br>•Computer-assisted news production<br>•Context based retrieval and indexing of news content<br>•Assisted material selection<br>•Efficient navigation and retrieval of live multimedia streams <br>•Automated trust estimation and opinion mining for news<br>•Ontologies and metadata schemes for media production and their applications<br>•HCI for efficient annotation and retrieval<br>•Automated cross-media linking <br>•Evaluation methods for multimedia content analysis tools data sets and standard resources<br>•Architectures and best-practices for integrating annotation tools in production workflows<br>•Tools for automatic handling information extraction tools results by using MPEG-7 AVDP<br>•User studies and usage trends<br><br>We are particularly interested in tools and solutions that are scalable and operate in real-time. <br><br>A considerable amount of audiovisual material taken from some of the major European broadcasters' archives is available for researchers. Perspective authors are encouraged to test their technologies on this real-life media production material. <br><br>Test material for experimentation is available at the Online Media Asset Management System "Mammie" provided by the organizers.

AIIDE-13: The Ninth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment<br>October 14-18, 2013<br>Boston, Massachusetts, USA<br><br>Submission deadlines:<br>Workshop proposals due Mar 15, 2013<br>Research papers due May 7, 2013<br>Practitioner track abstracts due May 7, 2013<br>Playable experience abstracts due May 7, 2013<br>Demonstration abstracts due May 7, 2013<br>Doctoral consortium applications due June 14, 2013<br>Paper acceptance notification: June 26, 2013<br><br>AIIDE-13 - the Ninth Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment – is intended to be the definitive point of interaction between entertainment software developers interested in AI and academic AI researchers. AIIDE-13 will include invited speakers, research and practitioner presentations, playable experiences, project demonstrations, interactive poster sessions, product exhibits, and a doctoral consortium. While traditionally emphasizing commercial computer and video games, we invite researchers and developers to share their insights and cutting-edge results on topics at the intersection of all forms of entertainment and artificial intelligence, including games for impact, entertainment robotics, art, and beyond. AIIDE-13 is sponsored by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI).<br><br>PAPERS<br>Because AIIDE-13 crosses disciplinary boundaries, submissions will be evaluated based on their accessibility to both commercial game developers and researchers in addition to their technical merit.<br><br>Research Track<br>Research Track papers describe AI research results that make advances towards solving known game AI problems, enable a new form of interactive digital entertainment, or use AI to improve the game design and development process. The novel technique should be validated in a game prototype or test-bed, but need not be tested in a commercial game. Research Track papers are evaluated by the highest standards of academic rigor. The highest rated papers will be presented in short lecture format. The next highest rated group of papers will be presented in a poster session. Authors should submit a paper of no more than 7 pages in the AAAI format for double blind review (i.e., authors names and affiliations are omitted).   The final page (page 7) must contain only references, and no other text whatsoever.  All papers, whether poster or oral, will be allocated 7 pages in the proceedings.<br><br>Practitioner Track<br>AIIDE also solicits submissions from professional game developers and artists on the use of artificial intelligence in games and other cultural artifacts.  While these practitioners are also invited to submit to the research track, we recognize that many will have neither the time nor the inclination to prepare full-length papers for archival academic publication.  These authors may instead submit a 500 word extended abstract to the practitioner track.  Practitioner track papers need not describe new technology, but must describe new ideas relevant to the AIIDE audience and must be based on experience creating deployed games or other cultural artifacts.  These papers are exempt from the formatting and blind reviewing requirements for the research track.  <br><br>Example Topics (List is Suggestive Only)<br>- AI in Game Design<br>AI as a source of novel game mechanics and genres<br>- AI-Based Production and Authoring Tools<br>Behavior-building, design frameworks, telemetry-supported game design, content authoring support, scripting, sketch-based authoring, automated playtesting<br>- AI Techniques for Games<br>Planning, reinforcement learning, search, neural networks, Bayesian models, evolutionary algorithms, case-based reasoning, constraint programming, utility-based approaches, animation, camera control, tactical/strategic decision making, terrain analysis, opponent modeling, dynamic difficulty adjustment, spatial decompositions, path planning<br>- AI Storytelling<br>Interactive drama, story generation, character development<br>- Autonomous Characters, NPCs, and Virtual Humans<br>Personality, emotion, believability, natural language processing, cognitive modeling, crowd simulation, social robotics<br>- Procedural Content Generation<br>Level generation, progression design, behavior adaptation<br>- Commercial AI Implementations<br>Case studies, implementation analysis, comparative evaluations<br>- AI in Novel Entertainment Applications<br>Entertainment robotics, virtual/mixed reality, mobile device games, geo-location based games, games for human-computation<br>- Computational Creativity and Generative Art<br>Painting, poetry, story, humor, music<br>- AI in Games for Impact<br>Training, education, intelligent tutoring, games for health, gamification<br><br><br>Submissions<br>Author Registration: Authors must register at the AIIDE-13 paper submission site before they submit their papers. The submission site (http://aiide.confmaster.net) will assign a password to be used for abstract and paper submission. Authors are encouraged to register as soon as possible, and well in advance of the submission deadline.<br><br>Paper Submission: Electronic abstract and paper submission through the AIIDE-13 paper submission site is required on or (preferably) before May 7. We cannot accept submissions by e-mail or fax.<br><br>All Research Track submissions must be in PDF format, no longer than 7 pages where page 7 must contain only references.  Papers should be formatted in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style (see the author instructions page). All Research Track papers must be formatted for BLIND REVIEW with NO author or affiliation information listed.<br><br>Practitioner Track extended abstracts must be submitted in PDF format and be approximately 500 words in length.  Authors should also include short bios describing their game industry experience (not counted toward the document length).   Papers should preferably be formatted in AAAI two-column, camera-ready style as above; however, Practitioner Track authors may submit their content in any reasonable format for review, and AIIDE will assign an editor to help meet publication formatting requirements for accepted work.  Authors of accepted abstracts will be invited to submit a full length paper to be published as part of a AAAI technical report. <br><br>Research Track papers and Practitioner Track extended abstracts must be submitted by May 7, 2013. All accepted papers will be published in the conference proceedings. At least one author must register for the conference by the deadline for camera-ready copy submission. As AIIDE is an academic conference, all attendees including presenters pay a registration fee. AIIDE-13 will not accept any paper that is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in another journal or conference.<br><br><br>DEMONSTRATIONS<br>We invite researchers and practitioners to share insights and cutting-edge results from a wide range of topics and encourage the demonstration of (a) research systems in the context of existing commercial games, (b) new games authored by researchers, (c) contributions demonstrating the adoption and/or extension of AI research results in published games, (d) completely new forms of interactive digital entertainment made possible by AI research, and (e) other relevant work. An electronic submission of a 2-page abstract and demonstration materials is required. Demonstration abstract review is not blind. Submissions should contain a link to the demonstration materials, which can take the form of a recorded demonstration session, an executable version of the demonstration with written instructions, or a detailed description of the demonstration heavily illustrated with screenshots. Please note that these materials are for review only and that all demonstrations will be conducted live at AIIDE-13. Demonstration authors should submit abstracts and materials by May 7, 2013. Submissions will be judged on technical merit, accessibility to developers and researchers, originality, presentation, and significance. Demonstration abstracts will be published in the conference proceedings.<br><br><br>PLAYABLE EXPERIENCES<br>Practitioners and researchers who are developing innovative AI-based games or other interactive media ("playable experiences") are invited to submit their work to the playable experiences track.  We welcome playable experiences that involve some articulable innovation in the use of AI that directly affects the user's experience.  This includes novel game designs that leverage existing AI techniques, as well as innovations in the techniques themselves that lead to new kinds of playable experiences. Playable experience submissions should be sufficiently complete and polished enough for naive users to play them.  Authors should submit a 500 word abstract describing the impetus behind the playable experience, how AI has motivated its design (or vice versa), and what they see as its primary innovation(s).   The abstract should include a publicly accessible link to a website that contains a link to download the playable experience and instructions for how to play it; this link must remain live at least through the end of the conference. Playable experience review is not blind.  The abstract will be published in the conference proceedings, and the authors will have the opportunity to show their playable experience during the evening poster/demo session of the AIIDE conference.  An electronic submission of the abstract is required by May 7, 2013.  If your work involves any specialized hardware or software that reviewers may not have access to, please contact the track chair Michael Mateas (michaelm@cs.ucsc.edu) prior to submission.<br><br><br>WORKSHOPS<br>The AIIDE 2013 committee invites proposals for one to two day workshops to be held on October 14-15. Workshop participants will have the opportunity to meet and discuss issues with a selected focus — providing an informal setting for active exchange among researchers, developers, and users on topics of current interest. Members of all segments of the AI in Digital Entertainment community as well as industry researchers are encouraged to submit proposals. The format of workshops will be determined by their organizers. Organizers are highly encouraged to propose alternative formats beyond paper/poster presentations, and should encourage the submission and presentation of position papers that discuss new research ideas. Workshop papers will be published as technical reports and will be archived in the AAAI digital library. Proposals for workshops should be about two (2) to three (3) pages in length. Workshop chairs must submit their proposals via email to the workshop chair, Julian Togelius (julian@togelius.com), by Mar 15, 2013.<br><br><br>DOCTORAL CONSORTIUM<br>AIIDE-13 will feature a Doctoral Consortium in which Ph.D. students will be invited to discuss and explore their research interests and career objectives with a panel of established researchers in AIIDE related fields. The consortium is intended primarily for early-stage Ph.D. students who have either not yet proposed their thesis topic or have recently done so.  Ph.D. students selected for the Doctoral Consortium will have the opportunity to present their research proposals at the DC session and/or at the poster session. Additionally, each student will be paired with a mentor, a senior member of the AIIDE community. Applications to attend the Doctoral Consortium will include a 4-page research summary, curriculum vita, a 1-page document stating what they hope to gain from attending the Doctoral Consortium, and a letter of recommendation from the dissertation advisor. Application packages are due on June 14, 2013.<br><br>EXHIBITS<br>AIIDE-13 will have exhibit space available.

(2) Abstracts for short presentation only. Both types of <br>papers should be submitted electronically using the EasyChair submission <br>page at<br><br>           http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aiml2012<br><br>At least one author of each accepted paper of abstract must register for, <br>and attend, the conference to present his or her work.<br><br>(1) FULL PAPERS. Authors are invited to submit, for presentation at the conference <br>and publication in the proceedings, full papers reporting on original research<br>and not submitted elsewhere. The proceedings of AiML'2012 will be published<br>by College Publications (http://www.collegepublications.co.uk) in a volume <br>to be made available at the conference. The submissions should be at <br>most 15 pages, with an optional technical appendix of up to 5 pages, together <br>with a plain-text abstract of 100-200 words. The submissions must be typeset in <br>LaTeX, using a style file and template that will be provided on the AiML'2012 <br>website.<br><br>(2) ABSTRACTS. These should be at most 5 pages. They may describe preliminary <br>results, work in progress etc., and will be subject to light reviewing. The <br>accepted abstracts will be made available at the conference, and the authors will<br>have the opportunity to make short presentations (of up to 15 minutes) on<br>them.<br><br>SPECIAL SESSION ON HYBRID LOGIC. Hybrid logic is an extension of modal logic <br>allowing to refer explicitly to states of the model in the syntax of formulas. <br>There will be a special session of AiML devoted to papers on hybrid logic. <br>The scope of the special session is standard hybrid-logical machinery like <br>nominals, satisfaction operators, and the downarrow binder, but also other <br>extensions of modal logic can be considered. <br><br>SPECIAL SESSION IN HONOUR OF LARISA MAKSIMOVA. There will be a <br>special session of AiML devoted to papers and talks in honour of Larisa <br>Maksimova, in recognition of her many outstanding contributions to modal <br>logic.<br><br>SPECIAL SESSION ON MODALITES FOR TYPES. Recent years have witnessed significant <br>growth of interest in constructive type-theoretical modalities, in particular <br>modalities ensuring productivity and type safety of (co-)recursive definitions in <br>reactive programming. Some earlier examples include the use of modalities for staged <br>computation, metaprogramming or in computational lambda-calculus. In order to boost <br>interaction between programming, type-theoretical and modal communities, AiML 2012 <br>will host a special session on these topics. Papers for this session should be <br>submitted to the EasyChair site along with others.<br><br>Papers for the special sessions should be submitted to the EasyChair site along with<br>others.<br><br>INVITED SPEAKERS<br>Lev Beklemishev (Moscow State University)<br>Johan van Benthem (University of Amsterdam and Stanford University)<br>Lars Birkedal (IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark)<br>Patrick Blackburn  (Roskilde University)<br>Balder ten Cate, (UC Santa Cruz)<br>Larisa Maksimova (Novosibirsk State University)<br><br>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE   <br>Carlos Areces (FaMAF, Universitad Nacional de Cordoba, Argentina)<br>Philippe Balbiani (IRIT, Toulouse, France)<br>Lev Beklemishev (Moscow State University, Russia)<br>Guram Bezhanishvili (New Mexico State University, USA)<br>Nick Bezhanishvili (Imperial College London, UK)<br>Patrick Blackburn (Roskilde University, Denmark)<br>Thomas Bolander (Technical University of Denmark)<br>Torben Brauner (Roskilde University, Denmark)<br>Giovanna Corsi (UniversitÃ  di Bologna, Italy)<br>Giovanna D'Agostino (UniversitÃ  di Udine, Italy)<br>Stephane Demri (LSV, ENS Cachan, France)<br>Melvin Fitting (Lehman College, CUNY, USA)<br>Robert Goldblatt (Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand)<br>Valentin Goranko (Technical University of Denmark)<br>Rajeev Gore (Australian National University, Australia)<br>Andreas Herzig (IRIT, Toulouse, France)<br>Ian Hodkinson (Imperial College London, UK)<br>Wiebe van der Hoek (University of Liverpool, UK)<br>Rosalie Iemhoff (University of Utrecht, The Netherlands)<br>Alexander Kurz (University of Leicester, UK)<br>Tadeusz Litak (University of Leicester, UK)<br>Hiroakira Ono (Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)<br>Martin Otto (Technical University of Darmstadt, Germany)<br>Alessandra Palmigiano (ILLC, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands)<br>Renate Schmidt (University of Manchester, UK)<br>Lutz SchrÃ¶der (DFKI GmbH and University of Bremen, Germany)<br>Valentin Shehtman (Moscow State University, Russia)<br>Dimiter Vakarelov (Sofia University, Bulgaria)<br>Yde Venema (ILLC, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands)<br>Heinrich Wansing (Ruhr University Bochum, Germany)<br>Frank Wolter (University of Liverpool, UK)<br>Michael Zakharyaschev (Birkbeck College, London, UK)<br><br>PROGRAMME COMMITTEE CO-CHAIRS<br>Silvio Ghilardi (UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano, Italy)<br>Lawrence Moss (Indiana University, USA)<br><br>ORGANIZING COMMITTEE CO-CHAIRS<br>Thomas Bolander (Technical University of Denmark)<br>Torben Brauner (Roskilde University, Denmark)<br><br>IMPORTANT DATES   <br>Full papers submission deadline: 30 March 2012   <br>Full papers acceptance notification: 18 May 2012<br>Short presentations submission deadline: 1 June, 2012<br>Short presentations acceptance notification: 18 June, 2012<br>Final version of full papers and abstracts due: 15 June 2012<br>Conference: 22-25 August, 2012.    <br><br>FURTHER INFORMATION.

The 7th International Conference on<br>Autonomous Infrastructure, Management and Security (AIMS 2013)<br><br>June 25-28, 2013, UPC Barcelona, Spain<br><br>http://www.aims-conference.org/2013/<br><br>**********************************************************************<br><br>The AIMS conference is a single-track event integrating normal<br>conference paper sessions, tutorials, keynotes, and a PhD student<br>workshop into a highly interactive event. One of the goals of AIMS is<br>to look beyond borders and to stimulate the exchange of ideas across<br>researchers of different communities and among PhD<br>students. Furthermore, AIMS 2013 integrates 1.5 days of courses and<br>labs which offer hands-on learning experiences in network and service<br>management topics and which require attendees to work in practical<br>on-site courses combined with preceding short tutorial-like teaching<br>sessions.<br><br>AIMS 2013 focuses on the theme of managing and monitoring of<br>next-generation networks, network security and services. New paradigms<br>as well as autonomic and fully distributed algorithms, virtualization<br>and monitoring techniques or self-organizing overlays have to be<br>investigated to design scalable and resilient frameworks able to deal<br>with dynamic environments providing big data to process while also<br>protecting privacy. The design, monitoring, configuration and<br>protection of the next generation of networked systems in an<br>efficient, secure, and autonomic manner are crucial to commercially<br>viable and successful networks and services.<br><br>Authors are invited to submit papers on the following topics,<br>including related fields:<br><br>Network Management and Operational Experience<br>- Internet of things<br>- Sensor networks<br>- Smart grids<br>- SCADA networks<br>- P2P and overlay networks<br>- Information Centric Networks<br>- Big data<br>- Future Internet<br>- Virtualized environments<br><br>Management Functions<br>- Detection of attacks<br>- Protection of infrastructures and services<br>- Security monitoring<br>- Configuration management<br>- Accounting of systems, services and behaviors<br>- Service provisioning<br>- Resilience of management infrastructures and services<br>- Privacy of collected data<br>- Quality of service and experience<br><br>Techniques and Methodologies<br>- Autonomous management<br>- Distributed monitoring and correlation<br>- Knowledge plane design and deployment<br>- Adaptability and self-organization<br>- P2P-based management<br>- Modeling of management technologies and procedures<br>- Machine learning<br>- Decision algorithms<br>- Flow-based management<br>- Scalability of management infrastructures<br><br>Conference Paper Submission:<br><br>Only original, full papers that have not been published or submitted<br>for publication elsewhere can be submitted. Each submission will be<br>limited to 12 pages in the LNCS paper format. Papers exceeding 12<br>pages, multiple submissions, and self-plagiarized papers will be<br>rejected without further review. Paper submission is handled by the<br>JEMS system, accessible from the AIMS 2013 Web page.<br><br>PhD Student Workshop Submission:<br><br>The PhD student workshop is open to both PhD and prospective PhD<br>students. Authors are invited to submit short papers (4 pages, written<br>in English and in PDF format) describing the current state of their<br>research. The paper should include a clear description of the research<br>problem and the chosen approach, argue why the problem is hard and the<br>approach novel, and it should outline the results achieved to<br>date. Specific, low-level technical details should be avoided. Papers<br>should have no more than two authors – the student and the<br>advisor. Accepted submissions will be published in the AIMS 2013<br>proceedings.<br><br>Proceedings:<br><br>The conference proceedings will be published in Springer's Lecture<br>Notes of Computer Science (LNCS) series and will include the<br>conference papers as well as the PhD student workshop papers.<br><br>Important Dates:<br><br>- February 10, 2013: Paper registration and submission deadline<br>- March 19, 2013: Notification of acceptance<br>- April 9, 2013: Camera-ready papers due<br>- June 25-28, 2013: AIMS 2013 conference and summer school<br><br>General Chair<br>- Joan Serrat, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Spain<br><br>Technical Program Co-chairs<br>- Guillaume Doyen, Troyes University of Technology, France<br>- Martin Waldburger, University of Zürich, Switzerland<br><br>PhD Student Workshop Co-chairs<br>- Pavel Čeleda, Masaryk University, Czech Republic<br>- Anna Sperotto, University of Twente, The Netherlands<br><br>Labs Co-chairs<br>- Juan-Luis Gorricho, Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya, Spain<br>- Thomas Schaaf, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, Germany<br><br>Publications Chair<br>- Burkhard Stiller, University of Zürich, Switzerland<br><br>Steering Committee<br>- Olivier Festor, INRIA Nancy - Grand Est, France<br>- David Hausheer, Technical University Darmstadt, Germany<br>- Aiko Pras, University of Twente, The Netherlands<br>- Ramin Sadre, University of Twente, The Netherlands<br>- Burkhard Stiller, University of Zürich, Switzerland<br><br>Technical Program Committee<br>- Rémi Badonnel, ESIAL-Université Henri Poincaré Nancy 1, France<br>- Raouf Boutaba, University of Waterloo, Canada<br>- Marinos Charalambides, University College London, UK<br>- Isabelle Chrisment, LORIA University of Nancy, France<br>- Alexander Clemm, Cisco Systems, USA<br>- Alva Couch, Tufts University, USA<br>- Hermann De Meer, University of Passau, Germany<br>- Filip De Turck, Ghent University IBBT, Belgium<br>- Gabi Dreo Rodosek, University of Federal Armed Forces Munich, Germany<br>- Jérôme François, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg<br>- Alex Galis, University College London, UK<br>- Anandha Gopalan, Imperial College London, UK<br>- Lisandro Z.

AIRWEB'09 TOPICS<br><br>Adversarial Information Retrieval addresses tasks such as gathering,<br>indexing, filtering, retrieving and ranking information from collections<br>wherein a subset has been manipulated maliciously. On the Web, the<br>predominant form of such manipulation is "search engine spamming" (or<br>"spamdexing"), i.e., malicious attempts to influence the outcome of<br>ranking algorithms, aimed at getting an undeserved high ranking for some<br>items in the collection.<br><br>We solicit the following types of submissions on any aspect of<br>adversarial information retrieval on the Web:<br><br>* Full papers, decribing contributions to the field,<br>* Short papers, presenting work in progress, and<br>* Problem statements, explaining relevant, but unsolved or not<br>  adequately solved problems.<br><br>Particular areas of interest include, but are not limited to:<br><br>* Link spam<br>* Content spam<br>* Cloaking<br>* Blog/forum/wiki spam<br>* Tag spam<br>* Review and rating spam<br>* Click fraud detection<br>* Reverse engineering of ranking algorithms<br>* Web content filtering<br>* Online advertisement blocking<br>* Stealth crawling<br><br>The proceedings of the workshop will be included in the ACM Digital<br>Library. Full and short papers are limited to 8 and 4 pages,<br>respectively; problem statements will be permitted 2 pages.

Call for Symposium Proposals<br><br>The UK Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour (AISB) is pleased to announce its forthcoming convention to be held at the University of York, York, 4-7 April 2011. The AISB convention is an annual event organised as a number of collocated symposia interspersed with invited plenary talks. Proposals are welcomed in all areas relating to AI and cognitive science. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):<br><br>    * Animal cognition<br>    * Applications of AI<br>    * Biolinguistics<br>    * Cognitive neuroscience<br>    * Computer vision<br>    * Computational models of thought processes<br>    * Creativity<br>    * Distributed reasoning and swarm intelligence<br>    * Emergent behaviour<br>    * Evaluation of AI systems<br>    * Game theory<br>    * Human-robot interaction<br>    * Intelligent agents and multiagent systems<br>    * Intelligent user interfaces<br>    * Knowledge representation<br>    * Natural lanugage processing<br>    * Machine learning<br>    * Nature-inspired computer architectures<br>    * Philosophy of mind<br>    * Reasoning<br>    * Robotics<br>    * Search<br>    * Social intelligence<br>    * Statistical approaches to AI<br><br>Confirmed invited speakers so far include Alan Baddeley (York), Katie Slocombe (York) and Mark Steedman (Edinburgh).<br><br>Symposium organizers need to issue a call for papers, coordinate the reviewing process and assemble the symposium proceedings, leaving the convention team in charge of everything else. The convention format makes it perfect for establishing dialogue and collaboration in new areas of research, as well as across disciplines. We want to emphasise that proposals drawing more strongly on the cognitive science aspect of the AISB remit are particularly encouraged. A broader spread of topics will match well the relevant research at the host institution, the University of York, in particular at the Departments of Computer Science, Language and Linguistic Science, Psychology and the York Neuroimaging Centre.<br><br>The University of York is among the top ten universities in the UK, and one of the top 100 universities in the world. The 2011 convention will be held in the brand-new buildings of the Department of Computer Science and the adjacent Hub on the Heslington East Campus, a new multi-million pound development aiming to provide the University with space for growth and offer the best facilities to staff and students for research and teaching.<br><br>The deadline for symposium proposals is:<br><br>25 September 2010<br><br>Submissions should consist of a short (one page) case for support describing the relevance of the symposium (and including a justification for the proposed length of one or two days), and a preliminary call for papers.<br><br>Please send proposals (and any questions) to both chairs:<br><br>Dimitar Kazakov (kazakov|atSymbol|cs.york.ac.uk)<br>George Tsoulas (gt3|atSymbol|york.ac.uk)<br><br>We are looking forward to your submission.

The analytic tools and intelligent <br>behavior provided by these techniques makes AI and learning increasingly important for <br>autonoumous real-time analysis and decision-making in domains with a wealth of data or that <br>require quick reactions to ever-changing situations. Particularly, these intelligent <br>technologies offer new solutions to security problems involving Big Data analysis, which can be <br>scaled through cloud-computing. Further, the use of learning methods in security-sensitive domains <br>creates new frontiers for security research, in which adversaries may attempt to mislead or evade <br>intelligent machines.  The 2013 ACM Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Security (AISec) <br>provides a venue for presenting and discussing new developments in this fusion of security/privacy <br>with AI and machine learning.<br><br>We invite original research papers describing the use of AI or machine learning in security, <br>privacy and related problems. We also invite position and open problem papers discussing the <br>role of AI or machine learning in security and privacy. Submitted papers of these types may not <br>substantially overlap papers that have been published previously or that are simultaneously <br>submitted to a journal or conference/workshop proceedings. Finally we again welcome a <br>‘systematization of knowledge’ category of papers, which should distill the AI or machine <br>learning contributions of a previously published series of security papers.<br><br>Regular research, systematization of knowledge, and open/position paper submissions must be <br>at most 10 pages in double-column ACM format (note: pages must be numbered) excluding the <br>bibliography and well-marked appendices, and at most 12 pages overall. Committee members are <br>not required to read the appendices, so the paper should be intelligible without them. <br>Submissions need not be anonymized. We recommend the use of the ACM SIG Proceedings templates for <br>submissions. The ACM format is the required template for the camera-ready version. Accepted papers <br>will be published by the ACM Digital Library and/or ACM Press.<br><br>Submissions can be made through EasyChair at:  https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aisec2013<br><br>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br><br>** Theoretical topics related to security **<br>  * Adversarial Learning<br>  * Robust Statistics<br>  * Online Learning<br>  * Learning in stochastic games<br><br>** Security applications **<br>  * Computer Forensics<br>  * Spam detection<br>  * Phishing detection and prevention<br>  * Botnet detection<br>  * Intrusion detection and response<br>  * Malware identification<br>  * Authorship Identification<br>  * Big data analytics for security<br><br>** Security-related AI problems **<br>  * Distributed inference and decision making for security<br>  * Secure multiparty computation and cryptographic approaches<br>  * Privacy-preserving data mining<br>  * Adaptive side-channel attacks<br>  * Design and analysis of CAPTCHAs<br>  * AI approaches to trust and reputation<br>  * Vulnerability testing through intelligent probing (e.g. fuzzing)<br>  * Content-driven security policy management & access control<br>  * Techniques and methods for generating training and test sets<br>  * Anomalous behavior detection (e.g. for the purposes of fraud prevention, authentication)<br><br><br><br>IMPORTANT DATES<br>Paper submissions due:     July 22, 2013 (23:59 PDT)<br>Acceptance notification:     August 15, 2013<br>Camera ready due: August 30, 2013<br>Workshop: November 4, 2013<br><br>ORGANIZATION<br>General Chair - Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi   TU Darmstadt | CASED | Fraunhofer SIT | Intel ICRI-SC<br>Program Co-Chairs - Blaine Nelson University of Potsdam<br>                    Christos Dimitrakakis EPFL<br>                    Elaine Shi University of Maryland, College Park<br>Program Committee -<br>Battista Biggio University of Cagliari<br>Ulf Brefeld Technische Universität Darmstadt<br>Michael Brückner SoundCloud Inc.<br>Mike Burmester Florida State University<br>Alvaro A.

We invite submissions that present significant case studies in experimental analysis (such studies may tighten, extend, or otherwise improve current theoretical results) or in the implementation, testing, and evaluation of algorithms for realistic environments and scenarios, including specific applied areas (for example, databases, networks, operations research, computational biology and physics, computational geometry, and the world wide web) that present unique challenges in their underlying algorithmic problems. We also invite submissions that address methodological issues and standards in the context of empirical research on algorithms and data structures. The scientific program will include time for discussion and debate of topics in this rapidly evolving research area.<br>This workshop precedes the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA11) being held January 23-25, 2011.  The workshop will take place on the same day as the Analytic Algorithmics and Combinatorics (ANALCO11). Since researchers in both fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop.<br><br>Registrants from either workshop will be cross-registered with the other. Proceedings of ALENEX and ANALCO will be published openly and electronically in January 2011. A special issue of the ACM Journal of Experimental Algorithmics will be dedicated to selected papers from ALENEX10.<br><br>A paper that has been reviewed and accepted for presentation at SODA is not eligible for submission to ALENEX. We recognize, however, that some research projects spawn multiple papers that elaborate on different aspects of the work, and are willing to respond to inquiries about SODA, ALENEX, and ANALCO papers that may overlap. Papers of interest to both the ALENEX and the ANALCO communities are particularly encouraged. Such papers may be submitted to either workshop and will, as appropriate, be presented in a joint session. Inquiries regarding ALENEX may be sent to workshop organizers Matthias Müller-Hannemann (muellerh(at)informatik.uni-halle.de) or Renato Werneck (renatow(at)microsoft.com).<br>The ALENEX workshop is supported by SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) and SIGACT (ACM Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory).<br>Important Deadlines<br><br>SUBMISSION DEADLINE<br>Tuesday, October 5, 2010<br><br>PRE-REGISTRATION DEADLINE<br>December 20, 2010<br><br>HOTEL RESERVATION DEADLINE<br>December 20, 2010

Fifth International Workshop on<br>Algorithmic Aspects of Wireless Sensor Networks<br><br>July 11th 2009, Rhodes, Greece..<br><br>To be held in conjunction with ICALP 2009.<br><br>http://www.algosensors.org<br><br>SCOPE<br><br>Wireless ad-hoc sensor networks have recently become a very active research subject due to their high potential of providing diverse services to numerous important applications, including remote monitoring and tracking in environmental applications and low maintenance ambient intelligence in everyday life. The effective and efficient realization of such large scale, complex ad-hoc networking environments requires intensive, coordinated technical research and development efforts, especially in power aware, scalable, robust wireless distributed protocols, due to the unusual application requirements and the severe resource constraints of the sensor devices.<br><br>On the other hand, a solid foundational background seems necessary for sensor networks to achieve their full potential. It is a challenge for abstract modeling, algorithmic design and analysis to achieve provably efficient, scalable and fault-tolerant realizations of such huge, highly-dynamic, complex, non-conventional networks. Features including the extremely large number of sensor devices in the network, the severe power, computing and memory limitations, their dense, random deployment and frequent failures, pose new interesting abstract modeling, algorithmic design, analysis and implementation challenges of great practical impact.<br><br>TOPICS<br><br>Contributions solicited cover a variety of topics including but not limited to:<br><br>    * Abstract models of sensor networks<br>    * Virtual infrastructures<br>    * Infrastructure discovery<br>    * Methods for ad-hoc deployment/topology control<br>    * Data propagation and routing<br>    * Data aggregation/data compression<br>    * Error and erasure correcting codes for information dispersal<br>    * Energy management<br>    * Power saving schemes<br>    * Communication protocols<br>    * Medium access control<br>    * Localization<br>    * Tracking<br>    * Fault tolerance and dependability<br>    * Self-stabilization<br>    * Adaptiveness and Self-organization<br>    * Game theoretic aspects<br>    * Cryptography, Security and trust<br>    * Distributed computing issues<br>    * Time synchronization<br>    * Swarm computing<br>    * Mobile robotic sensors<br>    * Algorithms for RFID<br>    * Obstacle avoidance<br><br>IMPORTANT DATES<br><br>    * Submission deadline April 30, 2009<br>    * Acceptance notification May 30, 2009<br>    * Camera-ready pre-proceedings June 15, 2009<br>    * Camera-ready post-proceedings August 31, 2009 <br><br>PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br><br>    * James Aspnes, Yale<br>    * Chen Avin, Ben Gurion U.<br>    * Ed Coffman, Columbia U.<br>    * Shlomi Dolev, Ben Gurion U., Program Chair<br>    * Ted Herman, U. of Iowa<br>    * Seth Gilbert, EPFL<br>    * Chryssis Georgiou, U. of Cyprus<br>    * Mordecai Golin, Hong Kong UST<br>    * Maria Gradinariu Potop-Butucaru, Paris 6<br>    * Alex Kesselmen, Google<br>    * Darek Kowalski, U. of Liverpool<br>    * Evangelos Kranakis, Carleton<br>    * Danny Krizanc, Wesleyan<br>    * Limor Lahiani, Microsoft Israel R&D Center<br>    * Flaminia Luccio, U.

For example, the Semantic Web<br>promises machine-readable semantics and a machine-processable Web<br>through ontology-based annotation of static data on the Web and<br>Web-based dynamic applications and services. Such annotation<br>facilitates querying and aggregating data sources on the Web in a<br>unified manner, as well as automating discovery, selection and<br>composition of services. Reasoning technologies for services and data<br>on the Web have typically focused on Description Logic (e.g., OWL DL)<br>and Rule-based (RIF, RuleML) approaches and languages. In this<br>workshop we focus on the latter with a particular focus on Logic<br>Programming as a  viable candidate paradigm for enabling intelligent<br>and declarative Web applications.<br><br>Many workshops and conferences that are dedicated to the Web arena<br>deal mostly with generic topics and bring together people from a<br>variety of research fields with different understandings of the topic.<br>The plethora of these workshops and conferences make it hard to keep<br>track of the various approaches of a particular technology such as<br>Logic Programming in our case. We deliberately take a narrower focus<br>to advance the application of LP as a paradigm for declarative<br>knowledge representation and reasoning to the Web and Web services.<br>Towards this aim we bring together researchers working on applications<br>of LP to (Semantic) Web and Web services, as well as LP-based<br>foundations for Semantic Web and Web service languages. ALPSWS 2008 is<br>the 3rd workshop in its series, still following its original goals:<br><br>- Bringing together people from different sub-disciplines of LP and<br>  focus on technological solutions and applications from LP to the<br>  problems of the Web.<br>- Promoting further research in this interesting application field.<br><br><br>Topics:<br>-------<br><br>Possible topics include (but are not limited to):<br><br>* Logic Programming based approaches for reasoning about Semantic Web<br>  languages such as RDF, RDFS, WSML, OWL, OWL-S, RuleML, SA-WSDL,<br>  SPARQL, RIF<br>* Ontology Modeling and Mediation using Logic Programming<br>* Deductive query answering in a Semantic Web context<br>* Reasoning over large-scale ontologies<br>* Reasoning with large instance data in the presence of ontologies<br>* Logic-Programming based mashups for Linked Open Data<br>* Combinations of Logic Programming and Description Logics<br>* Modeling of and reasoning about Web services<br>* Applications of Reasoning about actions and dynamics in the context<br>  of Web service discovery and composition<br>* Interaction of Logic Programming and other technologies such as<br>  agents, constraint programming, etc. in a (Semantic) Web context<br>* Applications, use cases, experimental results and benchmarks<br>* Extensions of Logic Programming engines for Semantic Web (service)<br>  applications<br>* Extensions of Logic Programming paradigms to tackle Web challenges,<br>  e.g., fuzzy logic programming to deal with uncertainty on the Web <br>* Logic Programming and the application of Semantic Web technologies<br>  to Semantic content<br><br><br>Sumbission Details:<br>-------------------<br><br>We invite two forms of submission to this workshop: full papers and<br>short papers.<br><br>Full papers shall be up to 14 pages length, short papers 6 pages which<br>could include position papers, system descriptions or preliminary<br>work.

BACKGROUND <br><br>The major goal of the AMAST Conferences is to promote research that may lead to the setting of software technology on a firm, mathematical basis. This goal is achieved by a large international cooperation with contributions from both academia and industry. The virtues of a software technology developed on a mathematical basis include the provision of software that is <br><br>* correct, and the correctness can be proved mathematically, <br><br>* safe, so that it can be used in the implementation of critical systems, <br><br>* portable, i.e., independent of computing platforms and language generations, <br><br>* evolutionary, i.e. it adapts to the environment changes, and evolves with the problem domain,<br><br>* secure, so that its network and user interactions can be predicted and controlled.<br><br>All previous editions of the AMAST Conference, which were held at Iowa City (1989,1991), Twente (1993), Montreal (1995), Munich (1996), Sydney (1997), Manaus (1999), Iowa City (2000), Reunion Island (2002), Stirling (2004), Saaremaa (2006) and Urbana-Champaign (2008), made contributions to the AMAST goals by reporting and disseminating academic and industrial achievements within the AMAST area of interest. During these meetings, AMAST attracted an international following among researchers and practitioners interested in software technology, programming methodology and their algebraic and logical foundations. <br><br>The 2010 conference will be held in Lac-Beauport, a suburb of Québec City, Canada, and will be colocated with MPC '10 (21-23 June 2010). <br><br>TOPICS <br><br>As in previous years, we invite papers reporting original research on setting software technology on a firm mathematical basis. We expect two kinds of submissions: technical papers and system demonstrations. Of particular interest is research on using algebraic, logic, and other formalisms suitable as foundations for software technology, as well as software technologies developed by means of logic and algebraic methodologies. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following: <br><br>** Software technology <br>* systems software technology <br>* application software technology<br>* software architecture <br>* concurrent and reactive systems <br>* formal methods in industrial software development <br>* requirements engineering<br>* software synthesis <br>* evolutionary and adaptive software systems <br><br>** Programming methodology <br>* logic programming, functional programming, object paradigms <br>* constraint programming and concurrency <br>* program transformation and verification <br>* programming calculi <br>* specification languages and tools <br>* incremental development<br>* web programming and network computation <br><br>** Algebraic and logical foundations <br>* logic in computer science<br>* category theory, relation algebra, computational algebra <br>* algebraic foundations for languages, systems and specifications<br>* coinduction and coalgebraic methods <br>* logical frameworks and theorem proving <br>* logics of programs <br>* formal approaches to dependability and security<br><br>** Systems and tools (for system demonstrations or ordinary papers) <br>* software development environments <br>* provably correct software development <br>* validation and verification <br>* security tools<br>* system support for reuse <br>* tools for prototyping <br>* component based software development tools <br>* computer algebra systems <br>* theorem proving systems <br><br><br>PUBLICATION <br><br>As in the past, the proceedings of AMAST 2010 will be published by Springer in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. The preliminary version of the proceedings will be available at the conference. The final version will be distributed after the conference.<br><br>We invite prospective authors to submit electronically previously unpublished papers of high quality. Submissions should not have been published and should not be under consideration for publication elsewhere. Papers must be no longer than 15 pages (6 pages for system demonstrations) and should be prepared using LaTeX and the LNCS style that can be downloaded from http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html. The submission site and dates are at the beginning of this Call.<br><br>VENUE <br><br>The conference will be held in the Manoir St-Castin (http://www.hotelsvillegia.com/villegia_stcastin/pages-eg/). This resort is located on the shore of Beauport lake, 15 minutes from downtown Québec City (http://www.quebecregion.com/en/) and 15 minutes from the Jean-Lesage International Airport. <br><br>PROGRAM COMMITTEE<br><br>Paolo Baldan<br>Gilles Barthe<br>Michel Bidoit<br>Manfred Broy<br>E.P. de Vink<br>Jose Luiz Fiadeiro<br>Rob Goldblatt<br>Ichiro Hasuo<br>Rolf Hennicker<br>Michael Johnson (chair)<br>Helene Kirchner<br>Barbara Koenig<br>Narciso Marti Oliet<br>Michael Mislove<br>Larry Moss<br>Till Mossakowski<br>Peter D.

Towards Large-Scale Data from Real-World Environments<br><br>During the last 30 years, human-centered perceptual understanding tasks such as face/body detection/ tracking, facial characteristic analysis (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, and expression), face/gait based human identification, and from understanding simple hand gesture to complex human body language, activity and behaviour, have attracted researchers from both computational and psychological communities. To be able to build tractable models has significant scientific and practical values. For example, human-computer interaction, video indexing, visual surveillance, and Internet vision are active application areas. To that end, researchers have made substantial progress. However, significant challenges still remain.<br><br>This one-day workshop (AMFG2010) will provide a focused international forum to bring together researchers and research groups to review the status of recognition, analysis and modeling of face, gesture, and body, to discuss the challenges that we are facing, and to explore future directions. A particular interest and focus of this workshop will be placed upon large-scale data from real-world environments. The workshop will consist of two to three invited talks together with peer-reviewed regular papers (oral and poster). Original high-quality papers are solicited on a wide range of topics including:<br><br>    * Face and body language recognition in real-world environments with unknown/changing background, e.g., Internet image search, or Facebook, or crowded public spaces.<br>    * Soft biometrics and profiling: age, gender, and ethnicity classification by facial and/or body descriptions.<br>    * Novel mathematical modelling and algorithms, sensors and modalities for face & body gesture/action representation, analysis and recognition.<br>    * Novel applications based on robust detection, tracking and recognition of face, body and action.<br>    * Psychological studies that can assist in understanding computational modelling and building better automated computer vision systems.<br>    * Motion analysis, tracking and extraction of face and body models from image sequences captured by a single or multiple cameras from either a fixed or mobile platform.<br>    * Detection and recognition of face and body under large 3D rotation, illumination change, partial occlusion, and aging.<br>    * Face, gait and action recognition in low-quality, low-resolution video from fixed or mobile cameras.<br>    * Dynamics and learning for gesture, activity, and body behavior interpretation.<br><br>Workshop Co-Chairs<br><br>    * Wen-Yi Zhao, Intuitive Surgical, Inc.<br>    * Xiaoou Tang, Chinese University of Hong Kong<br>    * Shaogang Gong, Queen Mary University of London<br>    * Shuicheng Yan, National University of Singapore<br>

The 6th International Symposium on Autonomous Minirobots for Research and Edutainment (AMiRE) is to be held on 23-25 May 2011 at the Centre for Interdisciplinary Research, University of Bielefeld, Germany, under the patronage of the Centre of Excellence in Cognitive Interaction Technology. The leading theme of the AMiRE series of symposia is that small and inexpensive research, educational and entertainment robots have been and continue to be an important driving force for advancing autonomous robot technology. Thanks to the advances in microelectronic technology such as high performance and low power microprocessors, FPGAs, wireless communications and low cost CMOS cameras,  such robots are capable of serving as test beds for animal behaviour cognitive research, prototypes of large robotics systems such as service or field robots, and as general research tools for  autonomous robotics. <br><br>

Scope<br>The conference seeks papers devoted to issues that arise in all stages of deploying a market mechanism to solve a problem. This includes, but is not limited to, theoretical and empirical examination of questions such as:<br><br>Is a market the right mechanism for the problem? What are the externalities involved? What are the issues with central planning?<br>How should novel markets be organized? What is the "right" micro-structure for a given problem?<br>What is the best way to provide incentives? Is (real) money necessary?<br>Will the use of markets lead to the creation of artificial economies? What can we say about these economies?<br>What new problems arise because of the special nature of these markets (e.g., from everyone wanting to use a cluster around the time of a conference deadline)?<br>What protocols need to be in place for agents to participate in such markets (including everything from practical matters like integrating bidding protocols into the system to theoretical questions like incentive compatibility)?<br>Is there a need for new mechanisms for specific applications (e.g., auctions used in sponsored search were never used in other settings)? If so, what properties of applications warrant such mechanisms?<br>In addition to more traditional academic papers, we are also interested in experiences from the real world (case studies and new applications). Below are some sample application areas, though we welcome papers in all areas of market design.<br><br>Sample areas include:<br>Prediction markets<br>Student-school matching<br>Kidney exchanges<br>Combinatorial auctions<br>Content delivery networks<br>Resource allocation in networks<br>Sponsored search auctions<br>Road pricing<br>Papers<br><br>In order to accommodate people from different disciplinary traditions, papers may be submitted in two tracks:<br><br>An archival track: papers will be considered for both presentation and publication in the conference proceedings. Papers submitted in the archival track must conform to the layout specifications and page limits. Proceedings will be published by Springer.<br>A non-archival track: working papers in any format will be considered for oral presentation in the conference.<br>Authors can choose which track they are submitting to by using the appropriate layout format. All papers should be submitted through the conference website.<br><br>Important Dates<br><br>Full Papers due: April 15, 2011<br><br>Notification of Acceptance: May 27, 2011<br><br>Camera-ready Manuscripts due: June 15, 2011<br><br>Conference Dates: August 22-23, 2011 (NYC)<br><br>Submission Instructions<br>Please visit the Submission page on the conference website (http://www.ammaconference.org/cfp.shtml) for detailed submission requirements and procedures.

AMTA-2010<br><br>                  The Ninth Biennial Conference<br>        of the Association for Machine Translation in the Americas<br><br>             Westin Tabor Center, Denver, Colorado<br>                 October 31 - November 05, 2010<br><br><br>            PRELIMINARY ANNOUNCEMENT and CALL FOR PAPERS<br><br>           MACHINE TRANSLATION IN THE PRODUCTION PIPELINE<br><br>The ninth biennial conference of the Association for Machine Translation<br>in the Americas (AMTA-2010) will be held at the Westin Tabor Center in<br>Denver Colorado, Sunday, October 31 through Friday, November 5.  AMTA-2010 will take place immediately following the 51st Annual Conference of the<br>American Translators Association (ATA), also taking place in Denver,<br>October 27-30.  The two conferences are planning multiple coordinated<br>events around joint topics of interest.  These are designed to deepen MT<br>researchers' and developers' understanding of the needs of the commercial<br>translation industry and human translators, while also fostering<br>translators' understanding of modern MT technology and the role of<br>advanced translation automation in commercial translation processes.<br><br>In addition to a research track, the main AMTA-2010 conference program<br>will include presentation tracks for government and commercial users of MT<br>and a "Technology Showcase" of commercial and research-stage MT<br>technology.  The research program will include a peer-reviewed competitive "Student Research Workshop" designed to highlight and foster the work of<br>the next generation of MT researchers.  Tutorials will be held on Sunday,<br>October 31, and workshops will take place primarily on Thursday and<br>Friday, November 4-5.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Call for MT Research Papers at AMTA-2010<br><br>Contact: Hassan Sawaf (hassan (at) sawaf.de)<br><br>Machine Translation continues to be one of the most active research areas<br>within Natural Language Processing.  MT evaluations, such as those<br>conducted by NIST, provide ample evidence that the field of MT continues<br>to grow and attract more and more researchers.  Data-driven approaches<br>have become particularly fashionable in recent years.  These approaches<br>have generated systems that have been the top performers in recent<br>comparative evaluations.  Furthermore, the challenges of building<br>competitive MT systems have been significantly reduced with the<br>introduction of open source toolkits such as GIZA++ and MOSES.  This<br>development, exciting as it is, also bears the danger of introducing<br>uniformity into MT research.  AMTA aims to promote diversity in MT<br>research and actively seeks research papers across the entire range of the MT research spectrum for the AMTA-2010 research program.  We solicit<br>submissions in English of unpublished papers describing original research<br>on all aspects of Machine Translation.  We particularly encourage<br>submissions on topics related to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial translation settings.<br><br><br>Important dates:<br><br>- Submission deadline:           Monday, May 24<br>- Notifications of acceptance:   Monday, July 5<br>- Final "camera-ready" versions: Monday, August 16<br><br><br>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:<br><br>- Advances in data-driven MT (Statistical MT, Example-based MT, etc.)<br>- Advances in rule-based MT (Transfer-based MT, Interlingual MT, etc.)<br>- Lexicon and grammar acquisition and induction<br>- Hybrid approaches that integrate and unify aspects of rule-based MT and<br> statistical MT<br>- MT for resource-poor languages<br>- MT on resource-limited machinery (e.g. PDAs)<br>- Distributed architectures for large data MT<br>- Speech-to-speech or speech-to-text MT<br>- MT with OCR<br>- MT for communication (chats, blogs, social networks)<br>- Customization and adaptation of high-performance MT systems<br>- Deep integration of MT technology within translation and localization<br> pipelines<br>- MT Evaluation<br><br><br>Submission Instructions:<br><br>Papers should not be longer than 10 pages and should be in pdf format. Style files (Latex and MS Word) will be posted on the conference web-page<br>at:<br><br>http://amta2010.amtaweb.org/<br><br>To allow for blind reviewing, please do not include author names and<br>affiliations within the paper and avoid obvious self-references.<br><br>Detailed submission instructions will be posted on the conference website<br>in the near future and will be included in future announcements.<br><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>MT User Presentations:  Commercial Users and Translators<br><br>Contact: Mike Dillinger  ( mike@translationOptimization.com )<br><br>The Commercial User track will focus on how MT can meet business needs<br>such as just-in-time localization of critical information, provisioning of<br>technical support information, or creation of preliminary translations for post-editing.  Submissions should focus on the use of MT in a business<br>setting and how it is integrated with other technologies to support<br>business goals.<br><br>Important dates:<br><br>- Submissions due:                     Monday, June 28<br>- Notification of acceptance:           Monday, July 12<br>- Final "camera-ready" versions due:   Monday, August 16<br><br><br>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:<br><br>- Integrating MT and human translation<br>- Post-editing experiences and data about productivity<br>- ROI analyses of post-editing versus translation<br>- Use of MT to provide localization of data-driven, dynamic, or<br> user-specific information<br>- Use of MT to reduce localization time and/or cost<br>- Ways in which MT can be used to increase the scope of globalization<br> projects<br>- Managing change when implementing MT systems<br>- Open-source and low-cost MT tools: are they realistic and is there a<br> market for them?<br><br><br>What to submit:<br><br>Ideal presentations will clearly identify a business need and describe how<br>MT meets those needs, with a candid assessment of its strengths and<br>limitations for that particular usage.  Submissions should be 250-500 word summaries and may be sent directly in e-mail or as attachments in RTF<br>format.<br><br><br>How to submit:<br><br>Send submissions or questions by email to Mike Dillinger (mike@translationOptimization.com) by Monday, June 28.<br><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>MT User Presentations:  Government Users and Translation Professionals<br><br>Contacts: Nick Bemish  ( Nicholas.Bemish@dia.mil )<br>       Chuck Simmons ( Charles.Simmons@wpafb.af.mil )<br><br><br>AMTA Government User presenters and participants will focus on the<br>strategic nature and use of Machine Translation in governmental<br>organizations.  Most governmental entities are providing a benefit to<br>their customers, who require them to translate large volumes of<br>information and to make it available across multiple languages and varied<br>network architectures.  The need for language translation technology<br>within governmental organizations is diverse and sometimes compartmented.<br>Governments are looking to advances in Machine Translation technology,<br>which help them deliver information not only from the native languages of various countries but also into those other languages.  In<br>turn, the information delivered helps the governments to understand social<br>and political activities in context.  In an age when significant volumes<br>of data are available in many languages, it is necessary to look to<br>automated alternatives, which assist the linguist and enable the human<br>translation process.<br><br>For this year's AMTA conference, we are asking government participants to<br>consider topics that address the strategic challenges of applying MT tools<br>and applications in their programs and processes.  We are looking for<br>representation from all government organizations that face language<br>challenges, including: Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human<br>Services, Human Resources, Commerce, Labor, Energy, Judiciary, Business,<br>Trade, Transportation, and many others.  Within the governmental<br>organizations we request the attendance of leaders or their<br>representatives, who can address challenging topics ranging among:<br><br>1.  Acquisition strategies that include policies directed towards      implementation of MT<br>2.  Funding priorities that stress the need for metrics to ensure adequate     return on investment (ROI)<br>3.  Requirements development which include a broad audience of users<br>   across the federal workspace<br>4.  Computer systems and network architectures that support inclusion of<br>   MT tools and any significant integration and security challenges<br>5.  Research and development leading to the advancement of tools that<br>   support less commonly used languages or minimizes gaps<br>6.  Program management strategies and how they apply to the integration<br>   and acceptance of MT tool usage<br>7.  Case studies on examples of MT use and how it impacts the<br>   organizations ability to share content<br>8.  Strategic views and objectives pertaining to challenges with respect<br>   to MT programs and the employment of MT tools (e.g., IT, personnel,<br>   implementation)<br>9.  Implementation strategies that factor into MT use as a process<br>   supporting human translation (pre-translation/post-editing)<br><br>The sessions will be structured to provide open and constructive dialogue<br>among attendees with diverse technical backgrounds and areas of expertise. A secondary objective of this approach is to establish longer-term<br>connections among participants and foster new cooperative efforts.<br><br><br>Important dates:<br><br>- Submissions due:                     Monday, June 28<br>- Notification of acceptance:          Monday, July 12<br>- Final "camera-ready" versions due:   Monday, August 16<br><br><br>What to submit:<br><br>Ideal proposals should include information on strategic views and<br>objectives pertaining to MT programs; employment of MT tools and<br>significant challenges; as well as information on achievable gains through usage and/or metrics.  Submissions should be 250-400 word summaries and<br>may be sent directly in e-mail or as attachments in RTF format.<br><br><br>How to submit:<br><br>Send submissions and questions to Government User program chairs, Nicholas Bemish at Nicholas.Bemish@dia.mil and Chuck Simmons at<br>Charles.Simmons@wpafb.af.mil  by Monday, June 28.<br><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Student Research Workshop<br><br>Contact: Stephan Vogel ( stephan.vogel@cs.cmu.edu )<br><br>AMTA-2010 will feature a Student Research Workshop, which will be embedded<br>as an integral part of the research program at the conference.  Students<br>at all levels of study (undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate) are<br>invited to submit papers describing their research work.  To qualify, the<br>main author of the paper must be a student or a post-doc.  Both completed<br>work as well as work in progress is eligible for submission. Submissions<br>will be competitively reviewed by a committee consisting of both advanced<br>MT students and senior researchers, in a process similar to the reviewing<br>of submissions to the main AMTA-2010 research program.  We hope to provide travel and participation financial support to the students selected for<br>presentations.  Details will be posted on the conference website when available.<br><br><br>Important dates:<br><br>- Submission deadline:           Monday, May 24<br>- Notifications of acceptance:   Monday, July 5<br>- Final "camera-ready" versions: Monday, August 16<br><br><br>Topics:<br><br>All topics related to MT research are welcome.

Style files (Latex and MS<br>Word) will be posted on the conference web-page at:<br><br>http://amta2010.amtaweb.org/<br><br>To allow for blind reviewing, please do not include author names and affiliations within the paper and avoid obvious self-references.<br><br>Detailed submission instructions will be posted on the conference website<br>in the near future and will be included in future announcements.<br><br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Call for Proposals for Workshops, Tutorials and Panels at AMTA-2010<br><br>Contact: George Foster ( george.foster@nrc.gc.ca )<br><br>AMTA 2010 is seeking proposals for workshops, tutorials and plenary panels<br>on all topics related to MT.  We particularly encourage proposals on<br>topics related to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial<br>translation settings.<br><br>Tutorials will be held on Sunday, October 31, immediately preceding the<br>main conference.  Workshops will be held on Thursday and Friday, November<br>4-5, immediately following the main conference.  Selected panels will be<br>an integral part of the main conference.<br><br><br>Aims:<br><br>Tutorials at AMTA conferences are a forum for experts in MT and MT-related areas to deliver concentrated training on a topic of interest in half-day<br>(or occasionally full-day) teaching sessions.  Tutorials provide<br>background that helps conference participants (especially newcomers to the field) understand the conference program, and/or enrich their<br>understanding of particular technical, applied, and business matters<br>surrounding research, development and use of MT and translation<br>technology.<br><br>AMTA workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT-related<br>communities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state<br>of thinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or<br>endeavor.<br><br>Panel sessions within the main conference program provide an opportunity<br>for a select number of experts to provide their perspective and hold a<br>discussion on a concrete topic of interest or developing issue within the<br>field of MT.<br><br>Due to AMTA 2010's collocation with the ATA meeting, we are particularly<br>interested in proposals related to commercialization of MT and/or its use<br>by professional translators.  However, any themes connected to MT<br>research, development, deployment, use, and evaluation are welcome.<br><br><br>What to submit:<br><br>Proposals for workshops, tutorials and panel sessions should be submitted<br>by June 30, 2010 to George Foster (george.foster@nrc.gc.ca).  They should<br>include the proposed format (workshop, tutorial or panel), a title, a<br>one-page description of the proposed content, technical requirements and<br>the expected number of participants.  In the case of a workshop, the<br>proposal should also include dates for important milestones (call for<br>papers, recruitment of speakers, etc.), and whether this is an ongoing or<br>new workshop.  Workshop and Tutorial proposals must also include a signed<br>copy of the AMTA Workshop or Tutorial Policy and Leader Agreement Form.

AMTA-2010 will take<br>place immediately following the 51st Annual Conference of the American<br>Translators Association (ATA), also taking place in Denver, October 27-30.<br>The two conferences are planning multiple coordinated events around joint<br>topics of interest.  These are designed to deepen MT researchers' and<br>developers' understanding of the needs of the commercial translation industry<br>and human translators, while also fostering translators' understanding of<br>modern MT technology and the role of advanced translation automation in<br>commercial translation processes.<br><br>In addition to a research track, the main AMTA-2010 conference program will <br>include presentation tracks for government and commercial users of MT and a<br>"Technology Showcase" of commercial and research-stage MT technology.  The<br>research program will include a peer-reviewed competitive "Student Research <br>Workshop" designed to highlight and foster the work of the next generation of<br>MT researchers.  Tutorials will be held on Sunday, October 31, and workshops<br>will take place primarily on Thursday and Friday, November 4-5.<br><br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Call for MT Research Papers at AMTA-2010<br><br>Contact: Hassan Sawaf (hassan (at) sawaf.de)<br><br>Machine Translation continues to be one of the most active research areas<br>within Natural Language Processing.  MT evaluations, such as those conducted<br>by NIST, provide ample evidence that the field of MT continues to grow and<br>attract more and more researchers.  Data-driven approaches have become<br>particularly fashionable in recent years.  These approaches have generated<br>systems that have been the top performers in recent comparative evaluations.<br>Furthermore, the challenges of building competitive MT systems have been<br>significantly reduced with the introduction of open source toolkits such as<br>GIZA++ and MOSES.  This development, exciting as it is, also bears the danger<br>of introducing uniformity into MT research.  AMTA aims to promote diversity in<br>MT research and actively seeks research papers across the entire range of the<br>MT research spectrum for the AMTA-2010 research program.  We solicit<br>submissions in English of unpublished papers describing original research on<br>all aspects of Machine Translation.  We particularly encourage submissions on<br>topics related to the conference theme of MT applied within commercial<br>translation settings.<br><br><br>Important dates:<br><br>- Submission deadline:           Monday, May 24<br>- Notifications of acceptance:   Monday, July 5<br>- Final "camera-ready" versions: Monday, August 16<br><br><br>Topics of interest include but are not limited to:<br><br>- Advances in data-driven MT (Statistical MT, Example-based MT, etc.)<br>- Advances in rule-based MT (Transfer-based MT, Interlingual MT, etc.)<br>- Lexicon and grammar acquisition and induction<br>- Hybrid approaches that integrate and unify aspects of rule-based MT and <br>  statistical MT<br>- MT for resource-poor languages<br>- MT on resource-limited machinery (e.g. PDAs)<br>- Distributed architectures for large data MT<br>- Speech-to-speech or speech-to-text MT<br>- MT with OCR<br>- MT for communication (chats, blogs, social networks)<br>- Customization and adaptation of high-performance MT systems<br>- Deep integration of MT technology within translation and localization<br>  pipelines<br>- MT Evaluation<br><br><br>Submission Instructions:<br><br>Papers should not be longer than 10 pages and should be in pdf format.

Most<br>governmental entities are providing a benefit to their customers, who require<br>them to translate large volumes of information and to make it available across<br>multiple languages and varied network architectures.  The need for language<br>translation technology within governmental organizations is diverse and<br>sometimes compartmented.  Governments are looking to advances in Machine<br>Translation technology, which help them deliver information not only from the<br>native languages of various countries but also into those other languages.  In<br>turn, the information delivered helps the governments to understand social and<br>political activities in context.  In an age when significant volumes of data<br>are available in many languages, it is necessary to look to automated<br>alternatives, which assist the linguist and enable the human translation<br>process.<br><br>For this year's AMTA conference, we are asking government participants to<br>consider topics that address the strategic challenges of applying MT tools and<br>applications in their programs and processes.  We are looking for<br>representation from all government organizations that face language<br>challenges, including: Defense, Homeland Security, Health and Human Services,<br>Human Resources, Commerce, Labor, Energy, Judiciary, Business, Trade,<br>Transportation, and many others.  Within the governmental organizations we<br>request the attendance of leaders or their representatives, who can address<br>challenging topics ranging among:<br><br>1.  Acquisition strategies that include policies directed towards <br>    implementation of MT <br>2.  Funding priorities that stress the need for metrics to ensure adequate<br>    return on investment (ROI) <br>3.  Requirements development which include a broad audience of users across<br>    the federal workspace <br>4.  Computer systems and network architectures that support inclusion of MT<br>    tools and any significant integration and security challenges <br>5.  Research and development leading to the advancement of tools that support<br>    less commonly used languages or minimizes gaps <br>6.  Program management strategies and how they apply to the integration and<br>    acceptance of MT tool usage <br>7.  Case studies on examples of MT use and how it impacts the organizations<br>    ability to share content <br>8.  Strategic views and objectives pertaining to challenges with respect to MT<br>    programs and the employment of MT tools (e.g., IT, personnel,<br>    implementation) <br>9.  Implementation strategies that factor into MT use as a process supporting<br>    human translation (pre-translation/post-editing)<br><br>The sessions will be structured to provide open and constructive dialogue<br>among attendees with diverse technical backgrounds and areas of expertise.<br>A secondary objective of this approach is to establish longer-term<br>connections among participants and foster new cooperative efforts.<br><br><br>Important dates:<br><br>- Submissions due:                     Monday, June 28<br>- Notification of acceptance:          Monday, July 12<br>- Final "camera-ready" versions due:   Monday, August 16<br><br><br>What to submit:<br><br>Ideal proposals should include information on strategic views and objectives<br>pertaining to MT programs; employment of MT tools and significant challenges;<br>as well as information on achievable gains through usage and/or metrics.<br>Submissions should be 250-400 word summaries and may be sent directly in<br>e-mail or as attachments in RTF format.<br><br><br>How to submit:<br><br>Send submissions and questions to Government User program chairs, Nicholas<br>Bemish at Nicholas.Bemish@dia.mil and Chuck Simmons at<br>Charles.Simmons@wpafb.af.mil  by Monday, June 28.<br><br> <br>----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Student Research Workshop<br><br>Contact: Stephan Vogel ( stephan.vogel@cs.cmu.edu )<br><br>AMTA-2010 will feature a Student Research Workshop, which will be embedded as<br>an integral part of the research program at the conference.

We invite both papers that study properties of fundamental combinatorial structures that arise in practical computational applications (such as permutations, trees, strings, tries, and graphs) and papers that address the precise analysis of algorithms for processing such structures, including: average-case analysis; analysis of moments, extrema, and distributions; probabilistic analysis of randomized algorithms, and so on. Submissions that present significant new information about classic algorithms are welcome, as are new analyses of new algorithms that present unique analytic challenges. We also invite submissions that address tools and techniques for the analysis of algorithms and combinatorial structures, both mathematical and computational.<br><br>The scientific program will include invited talks, contributed research papers, and ample time for discussion and debate of topics in this area.<br><br>This workshop is co-located with the ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA11), and will take place the day preceding that conference. The workshop is also co-located with the Workshop on Algorithm Engineering and Experimentation (ALENEX11) and will take place on the same day. Since researchers in both fields are approaching the problem of learning detailed information about the performance of particular algorithms, we expect that interesting synergies will develop. <br><br>Registrants from either workshop will be cross-registered with the other. Proceedings of ALENEX and ANALCO will be available online in January 2011.<br><br>A paper that has been reviewed and accepted for presentation at SODA is not eligible for submission to ANALCO. We recognize, however that some research projects spawn multiple papers that elaborate on different aspects of the work and are willing to respond to inquiries about SODA, ALENEX, and ANALCO papers that may overlap.  Papers of interest to both the ALENEX and the ANALCO communities are particularly encouraged. Such papers may be submitted to either workshop and will, as appropriate, be presented in a joint session.<br>The ANALCO workshop is supported by SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics).<br>Important Deadlines<br><br>SUBMISSION DEADLINE<br>October 4, 2010<br><br>PRE-REGISTRATION DEADLINE<br>December 20, 2010<br><br>HOTEL RESERVATION DEADLINE<br>December 20, 2010

Since 2005, we are organizing an international conference "Algebraic Biology" that focuses on the application of computer algebra, automated reasoning, hybrid algebraic and numeric computation, which is also called symbolic computation, to all types of problems from biology: AB'05, AB'07, and AB'08. These conferences were quite successful. For the next issue of this conference, we would like to extend the range of mathematical methods in their applications.<br><br>In 2010, we will organize "Algebraic and Numeric Biology" (ANB'10), which is renamed after our traditional name, "Algebraic Biology", to consider its wider scope of mathematical methods, especially numeric computation. ANB'10 will be held at the RISC Institute, which has a long tradition in symbolic methods and, in addition, has nice conference facilities including our "RISC Castle", an 800 years old remodeled medieval building with nice restaurant.<br><br>ANB'10 is an international forum to promote discussion and interaction between researchers who apply different computational approaches to various issues in biology / life sciences.

Noisy unstructured text data is ubiquitous and abundant in real-world situations. Handling noisy text poses new challenges for Information Extraction (IE), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR) and Knowledge Management (KM). Special handling of noise as well as noise-robust IR and KM techniques are essential to overcome these challenges. As in the case of AND 07, 08 and 09, we intend that AND 2010 will provide researchers an opportunity to present their latest results toward addressing these challenges. We seek papers dealing with all aspects of noisy unstructured text data and its processing.<br><br>Topics of Interest (not limited to)<br>•	Methods for detecting and correcting errors in noisy text,<br>•	Information Retrieval from noisy text data,<br>•	Machine learning techniques for information extraction from noisy text,<br>•	Rule-based approaches for handling noisy text<br>•	Social network analysis involving noisy data<br>•	Crowd-sourcing methods for dealing with noisy data<br>•	Knowledge Management of noisy text data,<br>•	Automatic classification and clustering of noisy unstructured text data,<br>•	Noise-invariant document summarization techniques,<br>•	Text analysis techniques for analysis and mining of on-line communication texts such as<br>transcribed calls, web logs, chat logs, tweets, microblogs, facebook posts, and email exchanges,<br>•	Business Intelligence (BI) applications dealing with noisy text data,<br>•	Document Representation and Content Analysis of noisy text documents <br>•	Interplay between linguistic complexity and uncertainty characterizing noisy text data in downstream applications,<br>•	Formal theory on characterization of noise,<br>•	Genre recognition based on the type of noise,<br>•	Characterizing, modeling and accounting for historical language change,<br>•	Surveys relating to noisy text analytics<br>

Brussels, Belgium<br><br>Call for papers prepared on February 24, 2012<br>More details and up-to-date information at<br>http://iridia.ulb.ac.be/ants2012<br><br>The On-line Submission System is now Active!<br>===================<br><br>You can access the system by going to the web site:<br>https://www.conftool.net/ants2012/<br><br>Scope of the Conference<br>=======================<br><br>Swarm intelligence is a relatively new discipline that deals with the<br>study of self-organizing processes both in nature and in artificial<br>systems. Researchers in ethology and animal behavior have proposed<br>many models to explain interesting aspects of social insect behavior<br>such as self-organization and shape-formation. Recently, algorithms<br>and methods inspired by these models have been proposed to solve<br>difficult problems in many domains.<br><br>An example of a particularly successful research direction in swarm<br>intelligence is ant colony optimization, the main focus of which is on<br>discrete optimization problems. Ant colony optimization has been<br>applied successfully to a large number of difficult discrete<br>optimization problems including the traveling salesman problem, the<br>quadratic assignment problem, scheduling, vehicle routing, etc., as<br>well as to routing in telecommunication networks. Another interesting<br>approach is that of particle swarm optimization, that focuses on<br>continuous optimization problems. Here too, a number of successful<br>applications can be found in the recent literature. Swarm robotics is<br>another relevant field. Here, the focus is on applying swarm<br>intelligence techniques to the control of large groups of cooperating<br>autonomous robots.<br><br>ANTS 2012 will give researchers in swarm intelligence the opportunity<br>to meet, to present their latest research, and to discuss current<br>developments and applications.<br><br>The three-day conference will be held in Brussels, Belgium, on<br>September 12-14, 2012.<br><br>Relevant Research Areas<br>=======================<br><br>ANTS 2012 solicits contributions dealing with any aspect of swarm<br>intelligence. Typical, but not exclusive, topics of interest are:<br><br>Behavioral models of social insects or other animal societies that<br>can stimulate new algorithmic approaches.<br><br>Empirical and theoretical research in swarm intelligence.<br><br>Application of swarm intelligence methods, such as ant colony<br>optimization or particle swarm optimization, to real-world problems.<br><br>Theoretical and experimental research in swarm robotics systems.<br><br>Publication Details<br>===================<br><br>Conference proceedings will be published by Springer in the LNCS<br>series.<br><br>The journal Swarm Intelligence will publish a special issue dedicated<br>to ANTS 2012 that will contain extended versions of the best research<br>works presented at the conference. Further details will be<br>published on the web site.<br><br>Best Paper Award<br>================<br><br>A best paper award will be presented at the conference.

MODULARITY: aosd.2013<br><br>*** AOSD 2013 ***<br><br>March 25-29, 2013<br>Fukuoka, Japan<br>http://aosd.net/2013/<br><br>Overview of submission deadlines:<br><br>October 1st:<br>        - Workshop Proposals<br>October 8th:<br>        - Research Results Track<br>        - Modularity Visions Track<br>        - Industry Track<br><br>================================================================================<br>Call for Papers -- Research Results<br><br>Modularity transcending traditional abstraction boundaries is<br>essential for developing complex modern systems - particularly<br>software and software-intensive systems. Aspect-oriented and other new<br>forms of modularity and abstraction are attracting a great deal<br>attention across many domains within and beyond computer science. As<br>the premier international conference on modularity, AOSD continues to<br>advance our knowledge and understanding of separation of concerns,<br>modularity, and abstraction in the broadest senses of these terms.<br><br>The 2013 AOSD conference will comprise two main events: "Research<br>Results" and "Modularity Visions". Both events invite full, scholarly<br>papers of the highest quality on new ideas and results in areas that<br>include but are not limited to complex systems, software design and<br>engineering, programming languages, cyber-physical systems, and other<br>areas across the whole system life cycle.<br><br>Research Results papers are expected to contribute significant new<br>research results with rigorous and substantial validation of specific<br>technical claims based on scientifically sound reflections on<br>experience, analysis, or experimentation.<br><br>Modularity Visions papers (solicited in a separate call) are expected<br>to present compelling new ideas in modularity, including strong cases<br>for significance, novelty, validity, and potential impact based on<br>thorough scholarly argumentation and early results.<br><br>AOSD 2013 is deeply committed to eliciting works of the highest<br>caliber. To this aim, three separate paper submission deadlines and<br>review stages are offered. A paper accepted in any<br>round will be published in the proceedings and presented at the<br>conference. Promising papers submitted in an early round that are not<br>accepted may be invited to be revised and resubmitted for review by the<br>same reviewers in a later round. Authors of such invited resubmissions<br>are asked to also submit a letter explaining the revisions made to the<br>paper to address the reviewer's concerns. While there is no guarantee<br>that an invited resubmission paper will be accepted, this procedure,<br>similar to major revisions requested by journals, is designed to help<br>authors of promising work get their papers into the conference.<br>Of course, authors that submitted to an early round may, on their own<br>initiative, resubmit a rejected work in a subsequent round, in which<br>case new reviewers may be appointed.<br><br>Topics<br><br>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:<br><br>* Complex systems: Modularity has emerged as a vital theme in many<br>domains, from biology to economics to engineered systems to software<br>and software-intensive systems, and beyond. AOSD 2013 invites works<br>that explore and establish connections across such disciplinary<br>boundaries.<br>* Software design and engineering: Requirements and domain<br>engineering; architecture; synthesis; evolution; metrics and<br>evaluation; economics; testing analysis and verification; semantics;<br>composition and interference; traceability; methodology; patterns.<br>* Programming languages: Language design; compilation and<br>interpretation; verification and static program analysis; formal<br>languages and calculi; execution environments and dynamic weaving;<br>dynamic and scripting languages; domain-specific languages and other<br>support for new forms of abstraction.<br>* Varieties of modularity: Context orientation; feature orientation;<br>model-driven development; generative programming; software product<br>lines; traits; meta-programming and reflection; contracts and<br>components; view-based development.<br>* Tools: Aspect mining; evolution and reverse engineering;<br>crosscutting views; refactoring.<br>* Applications: Data-intensive computing; distributed and concurrent<br>systems; middleware; service-oriented computing systems;<br>cyber-physical systems; networking; cloud computing; pervasive<br>computing; runtime verification; computer systems performance; system<br>health monitoring and the enforcement of non-functional properties.<br><br>Important Dates -- Research Results<br><br>(all deadlines are in 2012, 23:59:59 Pago Pago/American Samoa time)<br><br>* Round 1: Submission: PASSED / Notification: PASSED<br>* Round 2: Submission: PASSED / Notification: September 10th<br>* Round 3: Submission: October 8th / Notification: December 10th<br><br>Instructions for Authors<br><br>Submissions to AOSD Research Results will be carried out<br>electronically via CyberChair. (Modularity Visions and Research<br>Results will have separate CyberChair URLs.) All papers must be<br>submitted in PDF format. Submissions must be no longer than 12 pages<br>(including bibliography, figures, and appendices) in standard ACM SIG<br>Proceedings format.<br><br>The submission deadline, length limitations, and formatting<br>instructions are firm: any submissions that deviate from these may be<br>rejected without review by the program chairs. Submitted papers must<br>adhere to SIGPLAN's republication policy.<br><br>Each paper should contain an explanation of its contributions in both<br>general and technical terms, clearly identifying what has been<br>accomplished, explaining why it is significant, and placing it in the<br>context of relevant prior work. Where appropriate, systems and<br>experimental data should be made available on the Web. Authors should<br>make the technical content of their papers understandable to a broad<br>but technically sophisticated audience.<br><br>Publication<br><br>Accepted papers will be published by the ACM in the main AOSD 2013<br>conference proceedings and will appear in the ACM Digital Library.<br>Authors of accepted papers are expected to revise their papers in<br>light of reviewers' comments, and to provide camera-ready versions of<br>the papers by the camera-ready deadline. All authors will also be<br>required to sign the standard ACM copyright form.<br><br>Program Chair -- Research Results<br><br>Jörg Kienzle, McGill University, Canada<br><br>Program Committee<br><br>Mehmet Aksit, University of Twente, The Netherlands<br>Shaukat Ali, Simula Research Laboratory, Norway<br>Sven Apel, Universitat Passau, Germany<br>João Araujo, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal<br>Christoph Bockisch, University of Twente, The Netherlands<br>Eric Bodden, EC SPRIDE / Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany<br>Walter Cazzola, Università degli Studi di Milano, Italy<br>Shigeru Chiba, The University of Tokyo, Japan<br>Erik Ernst, Aarhus University, Denmark<br>Robert France, Colorado State University, USA<br>Lidia Fuentes, Universidad de Málaga, Spain<br>Alessandro Garcia, PUC-Rio, Brazil<br>Jeff Gray, University of Alabama, USA<br>Stefan Hanenberg, Universität Duisburg-Essen, Germany<br>Robert Hirschfeld, Hasso-Plattner Institut, Germany<br>Wouter Joosen, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium<br>Shmuel Katz, Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Israel<br>Gregor Kiczales, University of British Columbia, Canada<br>Jacques Klein, University of Luxembourg, Luxembourg<br>Philippe Lahire, University Nice Sophia Antipolis, France<br>Karl Lieberherr, Northeastern University, USA<br>Mira Mezini, Technische Universität Darmstadt, Germany<br>Hridesh Rajan, Iowa State University, USA<br>Awais Rashid, Lancaster University, UK<br>Gunter Mussbacher, Carleton University, Canada<br>Mario Südholt, École des Mines de Nantes, France<br>Kevin Sullivan, University of Virginia, USA<br>Peri Tarr, IBM Thomas J.

Modularity<br>influences system diversity, dependability, performance, evolution,<br>the structure and the dynamics of the organizations that produce<br>systems, human understanding and management of systems, and ultimately<br>system value.<br><br>Yet the nature of and possibilities for modularity, limits to<br>modularity, the mechanisms needed to achieve it in given forms, and<br>its costs and benefits remain poorly understood. Significant advances<br>in modularity thus are possible and promise to yield breakthroughs in<br>our ability to conceive, design, develop, validate, integrate, deploy,<br>operate, and evolve modern information systems and their underlying<br>software artifacts.<br><br>The Modularity Visions track of AOSD 2013 (MV) seeks papers presenting<br>compelling insights into modularity in information systems, including<br>its nature, forms, mechanisms, consequences, limits, costs, and<br>benefits. Rather than ex post results, MV seeks promising ex ante<br>proposals for future work. The scope of MV is broad: open to<br>submissions from all areas of computer science, as well as from other<br>fields.<br><br>Reviewing Process<br><br>Reviewing will be based on norms applied to peer-reviewed proposals to<br>research programs that demand breakthrough potential. Papers must be<br>well written, must present new perspectives on, or approaches to,<br>important problems, must formulate clear hypotheses justified by<br>analysis or results from preliminary work, must evaluate potential<br>significance and risks, must articulate how progress can be evaluated,<br>and must discuss related and required future work.<br><br>There is a single submission deadline for MV (which is the same date<br>as RR Round 3). Papers submitted to MV will undergo a two-phase review<br>process. Each paper will first be reviewed by at least two members of<br>the program committee (PC). The PC will then recommend acceptance,<br>rejection, or an invitation to revise and resubmit. Invited revisions<br>will then be reviewed by at least one more member of the PC. Authors<br>of revised papers should explain how they responded to earlier<br>reviews. MV may include invited papers.<br><br>A paper accepted to the MV track will be published in the proceedings<br>and presented at the conference.<br><br>Important Dates -- Modularity Visions<br><br>* Submission: October 8th (same deadline as RR-3)<br>* Notification: December 10th<br><br>(all deadlines are in 2012, 23:59:59 Pago Pago/American Samoa time)<br><br>Program Co-Chairs — Modularity Visions<br><br>Elisa Baniassad, Australian National University<br>David H.

As software becomes larger and more complex, traditional<br>modularity techniques are no longer sufficient to create and maintain<br>software systems. The International Conference on Aspect-Oriented<br>Development (AOSD) is the premier conference on software modularity.<br>The AOSD 2013 industry track is calling on software professionals to<br>submit papers on modularity describing advanced solutions, state of<br>the art practices, problem descriptions, experiences, and system/tool<br>developments.<br><br>Topics<br><br>Domains of interest include, but are not limited to cloud computing,<br>middleware, desktop applications, financial, communications,<br>automotive, and languages/tools. Each domain has its own technologies,<br>development style, and business context. More specifically, AOSD 2013<br>is seeking submissions that address questions such as the following:<br><br>* How are traditional forms of modularity insufficient for solving<br>  complex technical problems?<br>* What novel techniques of modularity are being used?<br>* How is modularity being used at different stages of the software<br>  development process: requirements, design, architecture, modelling,<br>  programming, testing?<br>* Are techniques such as aspect-orientation, domain-specific<br>  languages, software services, generative programming, and<br>  meta-programming useful for creating well-modularized systems?<br>* Dependency management and provisioning tools such as p2, maven, and<br>  gradle help create large software from reusable components, but are<br>  they sufficient?<br>* Finally, what are the complications of producing and consuming<br>  modular software in the open source community?<br><br>Important Dates -- Industry Track<br><br>(all deadlines are in 2012, 23:59:59 Pago Pago/American Samoa time)<br><br>AOSD 2013 is deeply committed to eliciting works of the highest<br>caliber. To this aim, two separate paper submission deadlines and<br>review stages are offered. A paper accepted in either round will be<br>published in the web-proceedings and presented at the conference.<br>Promising papers submitted in an early round that are not accepted may<br>be invited to be revised and resubmitted for review in a later round.<br>Authors of such invited resubmissions are asked to also submit a<br>letter explaining the revisions made to the paper to address the<br>reviewer's concerns. While there is no guarantee that an invited<br>resubmission paper will be accepted, this procedure, similar to major<br>revisions requested by journals, is designed to help authors of<br>promising work get their papers into the conference.<br><br>* Round 1: Submission: PASSED / Notification: September 10th<br>* Round 2: Submission: October 8th / Notification: December 10th<br>(all deadlines are in 2012, 23:59:59 Pago Pago, American Samoa, time)<br><br>How to submit<br><br>Submissions to the AOSD 2013 industry track will be accepted at<br>http://aosd.net/2013/industry_track/submissions/. Submission should be<br>no longer than 10,000 characters and in markdown format.<br><br>Any images, figures, or graphs should be hosted at a third party image<br>sharing site such as Imgur and linked to from the submitted document.<br>The industry track organizing committee may migrate these images to<br>AOSD.net servers for the camera-ready copy.<br><br>Review process<br><br>Each submission will be reviewed by the AOSD 2013 industry program<br>committee. Evaluation is based mainly on the usefulness to the AOSD<br>community, i.e., each submission should describe its modularity issue<br>(problem, solution, practice, experience and/or system/tool<br>development) along with characteristics of its industrial domain<br>Explicit discussion on the issue is also required, such as analysis of<br>the problem, benefit/ drawbacks of the solutions, lessons learned from<br>the experience. Importance of the issues, deepness of their<br>discussions and understandability (technical soundness, clarity and<br>organization) will be evaluated. The committee may contact authors as<br>a part of review process.<br>================================================================================<br>Call for Workshop Proposals<br><br>Proposals' Deadline: 1st October 2012<br>Workshop Dates: 25th and 26th March 2013<br><br>As with previous AOSD conferences, Modularity: AOSD 2013 will host a<br>vibrant workshop programme. We invite proposals for one or two day<br>workshops to be hosted in conjunction with Modularity: AOSD 2013. We<br>encourage workshop proposals on all conference-related topics,<br>particularly those that are novel or emerging within the community.<br>However, the topics of the workshops are not limited to aspects and<br>AOSD.  The workshop chairs will evaluate each proposal based upon the<br>relevance of the workshop, it's potential to attract participants and<br>the likelihood of interesting results emerging. Precedence will be<br>given to those workshops that propose an innovative format and foster<br>a collaborative environment between participants. We also welcome<br>proposals for local workshops (i.e. those where English is not the<br>primary language), however, English based papers/discussions are<br>strongly encouraged.<br><br>Submission Guidelines<br><br>Workshop proposals must be authored by at least two organisers and<br>should contain the following sections:<br><br>1. Workshop Organisers' Information<br><br>* The name and contact information of each organiser.<br>* A brief (100 - 200 words) biography of each organiser, detailing<br>  their expertise that is relevant to the workshop and experience as a<br>  workshop organiser.<br>* Identify a primary contact for the workshop.<br><br>2. Workshop Details<br><br>* Workshop name and acronym.<br>* Workshop abstract (less than 200 words) describing the workshop.<br>  This should also be suitable for the conference website and advance<br>  program.<br>* A description of the workshop's topics, themes and motivation.<br>* What are the expected goals and results of the workshop? How will<br>  these be achieved?<br>* An overview of the workshop format, this should include activities<br>  to stimulate collaboration and interaction.<br>* What is the expected number of participants? How will the workshop<br>  attract this number of people?<br>* Details of previous workshops in this series or on similar topics.<br>* Does the workshop have any specific room requirements beyond a<br>  projector, whiteboard/flipcharts, etc.?<br><br>3. Preliminary Call for Papers<br><br>A preliminary call for papers should also be included in the workshop<br>proposal, this will naturally repeat some of the previous information<br>provided but should instead target potential workshop participants.<br>The following information should be included:<br><br>* Workshop name/acronym.<br>* Overview of the workshop including: motivation, topics and goals.<br>* Workshop format.<br>* Tentative important dates including submission date, notification<br>  date, camera-ready date, etc. (these should align to the suggested<br>  dates below).<br>* Submission guidelines (these should align with the guidelines<br>  suggested below) and procedure.<br>* Preliminary program committee.<br>* Website URL.<br><br>Workshop Proceedings<br><br>The workshop chairs are currently in negotiation with the ACM to<br>include the workshop proceedings in the ACM digital library. The<br>inclusion of a workshop's proceedings in the digital library is<br>optional and is at the discretion of each workshop's organisers.<br>However, for consistency we suggest each workshop request papers to be<br>submitted in ACM formatting and use the following dates for<br>submissions to meet ACM's publication deadlines:<br><br>* Workshop Paper submission deadline: 7th January 2013<br>* Workshop Paper notification date: 28th January 2013<br>* Workshop Paper camera-ready deadline: 18th February 2013<br><br><br>How to Submit<br><br>Workshop proposals must submitted on or before 1st October 2012 in PDF<br>format by emailing the workshop chairs at workshops@aosd.net There are<br>no strict page limits being enforced, however, organisers are strongly<br>encouraged to keep their proposals concise.<br><br><br>To ensure a balanced workshop program, the workshop chairs will work<br>closely with the other conference organisers and may suggest the<br>merging of workshops when deemed appropriate. Upon a workshop proposal<br>being accepted, the workshop organisers should create and maintain a<br>workshop website that contains the information set out in call for<br>papers as well as providing the workshop program in due course. The<br>workshop chairs will assist in co-ordinating publicity of the<br>workshops.

Papers should be no more than 10 pages in length conforming to the formatting instructions as outlined below.<br><br>Each paper will be judged on its originality, significance, technical quality, relevance and presentation. The quality of accepted papers is further strengthened by a low acceptance rate of below 30%.<br><br>APCCM proceedings will be published by the Australian Computer Society (ACS) in the CRPIT Series (http://www.crpit.com). Please note that it is CRPIT policy that at least one author of all accepted papers to the conferences and workshops in the series would both register and present at the event concerned. Failure to do so without a reason acceptable to the organisers of the event will result in the paper being retrospectively withdrawn from both the proceedings and all citation sources.<br>It is also CRPIT policy that all papers be original and not concurrently submitted elsewhere. Once again, we reserve the right to retrospectively withdraw a paper from the proceedings if we later find this not to be the case.<br><br>After the conference, authors of the papers will be invited to submit an extended version for publication in a journal to be announced.<br><br>Formatting Guidelines: The proceedings of this event will be published by the ACS as Volume "Conceptual Modelling 2014" in the CRPIT Series. The formatting requirements and resources for authors can be found on the CRPIT Authors Page (http://www.crpit.com/AuthorsSubmitting.html) together with a list of all upcoming volumes (http://www.crpit.com/VolumeIndexU.html). <br><br>Electronic Submission: Submission to APCCM 2014 will be electronically only via EasyChair.

The Symposium for Applied Perception in Graphics and Visualization APGV unites researchers in the fields of perception, graphics, and visualization. These fields can benefit from the exchange of ideas --- in particular research in computer graphics and visualization can benefit from and contribute to research in perception and vice versa<br><br>Our seventh annual event provides an intimate, immersive forum for exchanging ideas about areas of overlapping interests. We invite submissions of original work in the areas described above that broadly meet two goals of our community:<br><br>Goal 1. Use insights from perception to advance the design of methods for visual, auditory and haptic representation. Examples would include:<br><br>    * applications of insights from perception to the development of algorithms for more efficient, effective, or realistic modeling, rendering, and animation<br>    * applications of perception in the design and evaluation of methods for more effective representation and communication of data<br>    * computational aesthetics, stylization, and perceptual aspects of non-photorealistic rendering<br>    * perceptual issues arising due to fusion of digital imaging, computer vision, and computer graphics techniques<br>    * perception-inspired interfaces for immersive activities in virtual worlds<br><br>Goal 2. Advance and facilitate novel basic perception and cognition research that uses and is relevant to applications in computer graphics and visualization. Examples would include:<br><br>    * perception and visuomotor control in computer games, virtual and augmented environments<br>    * fundamental contributions in spatial and temporal vision  <br>    * integration of empirical perception research with computational models<br>    * color vision and color appearance modeling<br>    * the influence of attention and eye movements on visual perception and visual memory<br>    * statistical learning and perception of natural scenes<br>    * perception of shapes, surfaces and materials<br>    * visual illusions and perceptual organization having potential to enhance image depiction<br><br>PAPERS<br><br>Research can be submitted as a long paper (up to 8 pages and a 20 minute talk), a short paper (up to 4 pages + 15 min talk), or as a poster presentation (1 page abstract). Papers that are not accepted will automatically be considered for the poster session. Authors of posters accepted by this route will of course have the option to decline the opportunity to present a poster. Please check the formatting guidelines before submitting your work on http://www.apgv.org. Submissions do not need to be anonymous.<br><br>All papers will be carefully reviewed by our International Program committee. Papers will be evaluated as submitted, given the limited time between submission and final version. This year, under a recent agreement with the ACM Transactions on Applied Perception (TAP) and the ACM Publications Board, the strongest accepted papers will be accepted for "presentation" at APGV and accepted (with revisions) to ACM TAP. These papers will form the ACM TAP "APGV 2010 special issue," and will be given the designation "presented at APGV" as part of their TAP citation. For those papers so selected, we guarantee continuity of reviewers. Should a paper so selected not be adequately revised to the satisfaction of the editors for its final acceptance into TAP, it will revert to the APGV proceedings in the ACM Digital Library. Authors of such special issue papers must agree to present the paper at APGV. (As has always been the case, authors of regular APGV papers can still submit to TAP regular issues with appropriate additions.)<br><br>Authors of accepted papers must prepare a final electronic version of their paper that is "camera-ready". This electronic version will appear in the ACM Digital Library as well as a conference proceedings DVD.<br><br> <br>Organization<br><br>Program Chairs<br><br>Marty Banks, University of California, Berkeley<br>Katerina Mania, Technical University of Crete<br><br>Conference Chairs<br><br>Diego Gutierrez, Universidad de Zaragoza<br>Joe Kearney, University of Iowa

Background<br><br> APLAS aims to stimulate programming language research by providing a forum for the presentation of latest results and the exchange of ideas in programming languages and systems. APLAS is based in Asia, but is an international forum that serves the worldwide programming language community. <br><br> APLAS is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation of Software (AAFS) founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with many researchers from Europe and the USA. Past APLAS symposiums were successfully held in Kyoto (’12), Kenting (’11), Shanghai (’10), Seoul (’09), Bangalore (’08), Singapore (’07), Sydney (’06), Tsukuba (’05), Taipei (’04) and Beijing (’03) after three informal workshops. Proceedings of the past symposiums were published in Springer’s LNCS. <br><br>Topics<br><br> The symposium is devoted to foundational and practical issues in programming languages and systems. Papers are solicited on topics such as <br><br>semantics, logics, foundational theory; <br>design of languages, type systems and foundational calculi; <br>domain-specific languages; <br>compilers, interpreters, abstract machines; <br>program derivation, synthesis and transformation; <br>program analysis, verification, model-checking; <br>logic, constraint, probabilistic and quantum programming; <br>software security; <br>concurrency and parallelism; <br>tools and environments for programming and implementation. <br><br> Topics are not limited to those discussed in previous symposiums. Papers identifying future directions of programming and those addressing the rapid changes of the underlying computing platforms are especially welcome. Demonstration of systems and tools in the scope of APLAS are welcome to the System and Tool presentations category. Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic are welcome to consult with program chair prior to submission. <br><br>Submission<br><br> We solicit submissions in two categories: <br><br>Regular research papers<br>describing original scientific research results, including tool development and case studies. Regular research papers should not exceed 16 pages in the Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and figures. They should clearly identify what has been accomplished and why it is significant. Submissions will be judged on the basis of significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. In case of lack of space, proofs, experimental results, or any information supporting the technical results of the paper could be provided as an appendix or a link to a web page, but reviewers are not obliged to read them. <br><br>System and Tool presentations<br>describing systems or tools that support theory, program construction, reasoning, or program execution in the scope of APLAS. System and Tool presentations are expected to be centered around a demonstration. The paper and the demonstration should identify the novelties of the tools and use motivating examples. System and Tool papers should not exceed 8 pages in the Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and figures. Submissions will be judged based on both the papers and the described systems or tools. It is highly desirable that the tools are available on the web. <br><br> Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission web page: <br><br>https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aplas2013<br><br> Acceptable formats are PostScript or PDF. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for publication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English. The proceedings will be published as a volume in Springer’s LNCS series. Accepted papers must be presented at the conference. (While the general chair and the program chair cannot submit papers, other members of the program committee can.) <br><br>DatesAbstract due: 	10 June 2013 (Monday), 23:59 UTC<br>Submission due: 	14 June 2013 (Friday), 23:59 UTC<br>Notification: 	26 August 2013 (Monday)<br>Final paper due:	19 September 2013 (Thursday)<br>Conference: 	9–11 December 2013 (Monday–Wednesday)<br><br>OrganizersGeneral chair: 	Peter Schachte (University of Melbourne)<br>Program chair: 	Chung-chieh Shan (Indiana University)<br><br>Program committee:<br> Filippo Bonchi (CNRS, ENS-Lyon, France)<br> Yu-Fang Chen (Academia Sinica, Taiwan)<br> Shigeru Chiba (The University of Tokyo, Japan)<br> Jacques Garrigue (Nagoya University, Japan)<br> Robert Glück (University of Copenhagen, Denmark)<br> R.

2013 International Conference on Advanced Parallel Processing Technology <br>August 27-28 in Stockholm, Sweden<br><br>* Abstract submission deadline: May 9, 2013.<br><br>APPT is a biennial conference on parallel and distributed processing. Its scope covers all aspects of parallel and distributed computing technologies, including architectures, software systems and tools, algorithms, and applications. <br>With the worldwide information revolution, almost every business area starts to face big data issues. Research on big data is being raised as nation intentions. Industries, research organizations and even governments around the world have already participated in planning and executing large projects on mass data. We have stepped into the era of big data. Decisions in businesses and economics will rely on analysis of mass data instead of on experiences. Mass data will bring us new business models. The analysis of virtual societies on the Internet will have great impact on and even lead the shaping of our future society. In scientific research area, the paradigm of science development has transformed from computing simulation to data-based exploration. The analysis of mass data in research area will be an important approach to innovation. <br>APPT focuses on parallel computing, a central element in any big data processing solution.

The10th International Symposium on <br>Applied Reconfigurable Computing (ARC 2014)<br>14 - 16 April 2014, Algarve, Portugal<br><br>Call for Papers<br><br>Reconfigurable computing technologies offer the promise of substantial<br>performance gains over traditional architectures via customizing, even at<br>runtime, the topology of the underlying architecture to match the specific<br>needs of a given application.<br>Contemporary configurable architectures allow for the definition of <br>architectures with functional and storage units that match in function, <br>bit-width and control structures the specific needs of a given <br>computation.

Nowadays middleware systems are required to support various levels of flexibly to adapt to the increasing dynamism of new models of computation and new classes of applications. These include:<br>- Networked applications that must operate under resource constraints and intermittent network connections,<br>- Cyber-physical systems with a close integrate of computation, physical devices and interaction with the physical world,<br>- Open systems that are long lived, able to accept new components, remove existing components, and adapt to new situations,<br>- A new generation of networked interactive applications driven by the availability of devices such as smart phones and tablets,<br>- New levels of high performance computing, for example the goal of exa-scale computing systems,<br>- Applications assembled on the fly to meet specific needs, from diverse and heterogeneous components, leading to a need for infrastructure that enables assembly of trustworthy (reliable, secure...) systems given high-level goals and constraints.<br><br><br><br>Research Topics<br><br>The workshop will address an extensive set of topics related to adaptation mechanisms for context-aware services. The following contributions will be particularly welcome:<br>- Design and performance of adaptive and/or reflective middleware platforms.<br>- Experiences with adaptive and reflective technologies in specific domains—e.g., sensor networks, ubiquitous and pervasive computing, mobile computing, grid computing, P2P, Systems-of-Systems, etc.<br>- Cross-layer interactions and adaptation mechanisms including network, OS and device level techniques.<br>- Adaptation and reflection in heterogeneous execution paradigms—e.g., P2P networks, network-centric computing.<br>- Application of adaptive and reflective middleware techniques to achieve; reconfigurability and/or adaptability and/or separation of concerns.<br>- Incorporating non-functional properties into middleware—real-time, fault-tolerance, security, trust, privacy, etc.<br>- Fundamental developments in the theory and practice of reflection, as it relates to middleware.<br>- Techniques to improve performance and/or scalability of adaptive and reflective techniques.<br>- Evaluation methodologies for adaptive and reflective middleware.<br>- Approaches to maintain the integrity of adaptive and reflective technologies.<br>- Tool support for adaptive and reflective middleware.<br>- Design and programming abstractions to manage the complexity of adaptive and reflective mechanisms.<br>- Software engineering methodologies for the design and development of adaptive middleware.<br>- Methods for reasoning about services provided by adaptive/reflective middleware.<br>- The role of techniques such as learning in design of long lived adaptive middleware.<br>- Methods for asynchronous, distributed control, coordination/cooperation among components providing middleware services.<br><br><br><br>Workshop Format<br><br>The workshop will be organized as a series of sessions, each devoted to the presentation of papers belonging to a common domain. Each session will end with a mini-panel between the presenters, led by the session chair or a pre-selected devil's advocate. In past years this format has been found to lead to lively and productive discussions. The workshop will include a special session for the presentation of posters and demos of ongoing research efforts and software prototypes. The workshop will conclude with a panel, moderated by one of the organizers, to discuss open issues and future trends in the field.<br><br><br><br>Submission & Publication<br><br>Selection of workshop participants will be based on the submission of a paper, poster or demo. Moreover, other participants may be invited by the organizing committee. Thus, the ARM program committee seeks:<br>- Research papers should not exceed 6 pages of text on letter paper in ACM format. Content should be work that is not previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere;<br>- Poster submissions should initially submit a 2 page abstract describing the poster content in ACM format; this offers the opportunity to present and receive feedback at the workshop about work still in its early stages;<br>- Demo submissions should initially submit a 2 page abstract in ACM format, describing the contribution and content of the demo; we are particularly interested in demonstrations of adaptive middleware tools and solutions.<br><br>All submissions will be peer-reviewed, and selected based on their originality, technical strength and topical relevance. All accepted papers will be published via ACM's Digital Library as part of the "ACM International Conference Proceeding Series" (AICPS).

ArtsIT 2012 - http://artsit.org<br><br>Call for Papers<br><br>1. Scope<br><br>With the evolution of intelligent devices, sensors and ambient intelligent/ubiquitous systems, it is not surprising to see many researches and arts projects starting to explore the design of intelligent artistic artefacts. Ambient intelligence supports the vision that technology will become invisible, embedded in our natural surroundings, present whenever we need it, attuned to all our senses, adaptive to users and context and autonomously acting. High quality arts or information should be potentially available to any user, anywhere, at any time, with any device. The information environments will be the major drivers of culture which will eventually lead to the future space (intelligent, interactive, invisible and informative) - Utopia kind of life.<br><br>2. Topics<br><br>ArtsIT is by nature a multi-disciplinary conference. The call for papers is therefore aimed at people across a wide spectrum of interests and disciplines including computer science, design, arts, sociology, anthropology, psychology, and marketing.<br><br>We cordially invite prospective authors to submit unpublished research papers with novel contributions in the following areas:<br><br>- New Media Technologies (Evolutionary systems that create arts or display art works, such as tracking sensors, wearable computers, mixed reality, etc.)<br>- Software Art (Image processing or computer graphics techniques that create arts, including algorithmic art, mathematic art, advanced modelling and rendering, etc.)<br>- Animation Techniques (2D or 3D computer animations, AI-based animations, etc.)<br>- Multimedia (Integration of different media, such as virtual reality systems, audio, performing arts, etc.)<br>- Interactive Methods (Vision-based tracking and recognition, interactive art, etc.)<br><br>3. Conference proceedings and publications<br><br>All submitted contributions will undergo peer review. Reviews will be single blind (i.e., include authorship information with the submitted paper). Accepted papers will be published in the ArtsIT Conference Proceedings and by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes of ICST (LNICST). The proceedings will be available both in book form and via the SpringerLink digital library, and will be submitted for inclusion in leading indexing services, including DBLP, Google Scholar, ACM Digital Library, ISI Proceedings, EI Engineering Index, CrossRef, Scopus and Zentralblatt Math, as well as ICST's own EU Digital Library (EUDL).<br><br>Selected papers will appear in the International Journal of Arts & Technology (Inderscience).<br><br>A selection of the best papers from the on ArtAbilitation and GameAbilitation international symposiums will appear in the UAIS journal (Springer).<br><br>Authors with accepted special contributions will be asked to submit an extended version of their paper. A typical length for a long paper is between 20 and 30 pages. Please also note that 20-30 pages unformatted ordinary MS Word text would typically result in a shorter document of 12-20 pages, formatted according to the Springer guidelines.<br><br>4. Important Dates<br><br>Paper Submission Deadline: 1 October 2011<br>Notification of Acceptance: 15 October 2011<br>Camera Ready Deadline: 30 October, 2011<br>Conference Date: 7-9 December 2011<br><br>5.

The study of social networks originated in social and business communities. In recent years, social network research has advanced significantly; the development of sophisticated techniques for Social Network Analysis and Mining (SNAM) has been highly influenced by the online social Web sites, email logs, phone logs and instant messaging systems, which are widely analyzed using graph theory and machine learning techniques. People perceive the Web increasingly as a social medium that fosters interaction among people, sharing of experiences and knowledge, group activities, community formation and evolution. This has led to a rising prominence of SNAM in academia, politics, homeland security and business. This follows the pattern of known entities of our society that have evolved into networks in which actors are increasingly dependent on their structural embedding.<br><br>The international conference on Advances in Social Network Analysis and Mining (ASONAM 2013) will primarily provide an interdisciplinary venue that will bring together practitioners and researchers from a variety of SNAM fields to promote collaborations and exchange of ideas and practices. ASONAM 2013 is intended to address important aspects with a specific focus on the emerging trends and industry needs associated with social networking analysis and mining. The conference solicits experimental and theoretical works on social network analysis and mining along with their application to real life situations.<br><br>General areas of interest to ASONAM 2013 include information science and mathematics, communication studies, business and organizational studies, sociology, psychology, anthropology, applied linguistics, biology and medicine.<br><br>More specialized topics within ASONAM include, but are not limited to:<br><br>    Adoption of new services on social network platforms<br>    Agent based social simulation, agent based computational models<br>    Anomaly detection in social network evolution<br>    Application of social network analysis<br>    Application of social network mining<br>    Communities discovery and analysis in large scale online social networks<br>    Communities discovery and analysis in large scale offline social networks<br>    Connection between biological similarities and social network formulation<br>    Contextual social network analysis<br>    Contextual social network mining<br>    Crime data mining and network analysis<br>    Cyber anthropology<br>    Dark Web<br>    Data models for social networks and social media<br>    Data protection inside communities<br>    Detection of communities by document analysis<br>    Dynamics and evolution patterns of social networks<br>    Economical impact of social network discovery<br>    Evolution of patterns in the Web<br>    Evolution of communities in the Web<br>    Evolution of communities in organizations<br>    Geography of social networks<br>    Impact of social networks on recommendations systems<br>    Incorporating social information in query processing and query optimization<br>    Information acquisition and establishment of social relations<br>    Influence of cultural aspects on the formation of communities<br>    Knowledge networks<br>    Large-scale graph algorithms for social network analysis<br>    Misbehavior detection in communities<br>    Migration between communities<br>    Multi-Actor/Multiple-Relationship Networks<br>    Multi-agent based social network modeling and analysis<br>    Open source intelligence<br>    Pattern presentation for end-users and experts<br>    Personalization for search and for social interaction<br>    Preparing data for Web mining<br>    Political impact of social network discovery<br>    Privacy, security and civil liberty issues<br>    Recommendations for product purchase, information acquisition and establishment of social relations<br>    Recommendation networks<br>    Scalability of social networks<br>    Scalability of Search algorithms on social networks<br>    Social and cultural anthropology<br>    Social geography<br>    Social psychology of information diffusion<br>    Spatial Networks<br>    Statistical modeling of large networks<br>    Temporal analysis on social networks topologies<br>    Trust networks, evolution of trust<br>    Visual representation of dynamic social networks<br>    Web mining algorithms<br>    Web communities<br><br><br>Tentative deadlines<br><br>Papers reporting original and unpublished research results pertaining to the above topics are solicited (Proceeding indexed by EI).

ASPLOS is the premier forum for multidisciplinary systems research spanning computer architecture and hardware, programming languages and compilers, operating systems and networking, as well as applications and user interfaces. The research may target diverse goals such as performance, energy and thermal efficiency, resiliency, security, and sustainability. The importance of such cross-cutting research continues to grow as we grapple with the end of Dennard scaling, the explosion of big data, scales ranging from ultra-low power wearable devices to exascale parallel and cloud computers, the need for sustainability, and increasingly human-centered applications. ASPLOS embraces systems research that directly targets these new problems in new ways. ASPLOS 2014 invites papers on ground-breaking research on current and future computer systems. Submissions should emphasize synergy of at least two ASPLOS disciplines: architecture, programming languages, operating systems, and related areas. Non-traditional topics are especially encouraged. The review process will be sensitive to the challenges of multidisciplinary work in emerging areas. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:<br><br>•emerging platforms at all scales; e.g., networks of embedded devices, multicore client devices, and cloud systems<br>•applications and systems that address social, educational, and environmental challenges<br>•programming and compilation for existing and emerging platforms<br>•managing, storing, and computing on big data<br>•virtualization, memory, and storage technologies and architectures<br>•power, energy, and thermal management<br>•security, reliability, and availability<br>•verification and testing<br>•heterogeneous architectures and accelerators<br>•new computing models

Accepted papers, posters, demonstrations and experience reports will be archived in the ACM digital library.   At least one author of accepted submissions must register as the presenter by the early registration deadline.  Submissions MUST contain substantial original, unpublished material.   Please refer to the ACM policy on plagiarism for guidance.<br><br>Mentoring Requests: Help with submissions by seasoned researchers is available through the ASSETS Mentoring Program.  If you think you would benefit from mentoring either because you are new to presenting your research, new to the type of category you are interested in submitting to or simply find that preparing English language papers foreign to your paper writing experience, please consider applying for mentoring help by emailing the Mentor Chair (mc-assets13@acm.org) a 1-page extended abstract of your paper. <br><br>Technical Papers: Accepted technical papers will be presented at the conference and will appear in the conference proceedings. Authors of the best papers will be invited to submit extended versions to a special issue of the ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing (TACCESS).  Papers must be a maximum of 8 pages long, in the ACM conference format.  They should be submitted electronically via the conference Web site no later than 3 May 2013, Friday, midnight HAST (GMT-10.00).<br><br>Posters and Demonstrations: The Poster and Demonstration Session is an opportunity for presenting late-breaking results, ongoing research projects, and speculative or innovative work in progress.   A poster is a great way to test new ideas, generate interest in a research area, or describe useful or interesting work that is not substantial enough for a full paper presentation or present late-breaking result. A demonstration is a great way to communicate inventive accessible computing and IT technologies in action. Posters and demonstration proposals should be submitted using the ACM Conference format, and they are limited in length to 2 pages.  They should be submitted electronically via the conference Web site no later than 28 June 2013, Friday, midnight HAST (GMT-10.00).<br><br>Experience Reports: The value of accessible technology is measured ultimately by the experience of people who use it. ASSETS 2013 invites papers that reflect these experiences first-hand. An experience report is authored or co-authored by one or more persons who are in the intended audience for the technology discussed in the report. It describes these authors’ experience with the technology, positive or negative (and may describe the experience of other users, as well).  Posters and demonstration proposals should be submitted using the ACM Conference format, and they are limited in length to 6 pages.  They should be submitted electronically via the conference Web site no later than 28 June 2013, Friday, midnight HAST (GMT-10.00).<br><br>Doctoral Consortium: The Doctoral Consortium provides doctoral students the opportunity to share and discuss their research with other students and a panel of established researchers (led by Dr. Gregory Abowd, Georgia Tech) who will provide feedback on all aspects of the students’ research.  The consortium will be held on Sunday October 20, 2013.  Please note that the Doctoral Consortium Is intended to provide feedback to Doctoral candidates in the early stages of their work: student work that is complete or near completion should be submitted to the regular presentation/poster sessions.  We hope to provide travel support for those students selected for the consortium.  Submission requirements are stated on the conference website.  The submission deadline is June 28, 2013.  <br><br>Student Research Competition: The Student Research Competition provides both undergraduate and graduate students a chance to present their individual research and win awards for their work.  Only individual research is accepted: group research projects will not be considered unless only the individual’s part in it is presented.   Preference will be given to work that has been completed (or close to completion).  Participants must be currently enrolled in a university or college and have active ACM student membership.  Work accepted as a full paper for one of the technical sessions of the conference cannot also be considered for the Student Research Competition.  Abstracts for the initial stage of the competition should be submitted using the ACM Conference format, and they are limited in length to 2 pages.  They should be submitted electronically via the conference Web site no later than 28 June 2013, Friday, midnight HAST (GMT-10.00).  Further details about the subsequent competition stages are given on the conference website.<br><br>Captioning Competition: T o prepare for possible capture of sessions at future ASSETS conferences for later use, we want to explore approaches to captioning recordings of sessions. Because this is an active area of research for a number of groups in the ASSETS community, we invite participants for a competition to be held at ASSETS 2013 in which teams will use their technology to caption one or more of the sessions.  Our aim is to promote research that will make it possible for ASSETS, and other organizations, to create captions of good quality at very low cost.  If you are interested in participating, please contact the Captioning Competition Chair, Raja Kushalnalgar, at caption-assets13@acm.org.   <br><br><br>Awards:<br>The following awards will be made at ASSETS 2013 from those papers appearing in the ASSETS conference proceedings:<br>•	Best Technical Paper <br>•	Best Student paper (to be considered a student paper, the student must be the first author)<br><br>The selection process for these papers is based on the technical paper reviews from which the Program Chair selects a shortlist of best paper candidates.  These are discussed and reviewed by a selection committee drawn from the program committee. Membership on this selection committee is limited to those who have no conflict of interest with the shortlisted papers.  Recipients of the best paper awards will be presented with a certificate from ACM at the conference.<br><br><br>Important Dates<br>•	Requesting mentors: March 5, 2013, Tuesday<br>•	Technical paper submission: May 3, 2013, Friday<br>•	Notification of technical paper acceptance: June 14, 2013, Friday<br>•	Posters and demos submission: June 28, 2013, Friday<br>•	Experience Report submission: June 28, 2013, Friday<br>•	Doctoral consortium submission: June 28, 2013, Friday<br>•	Student research competition submission: June 28, 2013, Friday<br>•	Notification of posters and demos acceptance: July 24, 2013, Wednesday<br>•	Notification of experience reports acceptance: July 24, 2013, Wednesday<br>•	Notification of doctoral consortium acceptance: July 24, 2013, Wednesday<br>•	Notification of student research competition acceptance: July 24, 2013, Wednesday<br><br><br>Organizing Committee<br>General Chair<br>Clayton Lewis, University of Colorado, USA<br>gc-assets13@acm.org<br>Program Chair<br>Richard Ladner, University of Washington, USA<br>pc-assets13@acm.org<br>Program Chair Select<br>John Richards, IBM, USA<br>pc-assets13@acm.org<br>Treasurer and Registration Chair<br>Faustina Hwang, University of Reading, UK<br>trc-assets13@acm.org<br>Posters and Demonstrations Chair<br>Jinjuan Feng, Towson University, USA<br>pd-assets13@acm.org<br>Experience Reports Chair<br>Annalu Waller, University of Dundee, UK<br>er-assets13@acm.org<br>Doctoral Consortium Chair<br>Gregory Abowd, Georgia Institute of Technology, USA<br>dc-assets13@acm.org<br>Student Research Competition Chair<br>Ornella Mich, Fondazione Bruno Kessler, Italy<br>src-assets13@acm.org<br>Mentoring Chair<br>Joshua Hailpern, Hewlett Packard, USA<br>mc-assets13@acm.org<br>Local Arrangements Chair<br>Merrie Morris & Annuska Perkins, Microsoft, USA<br>local-assets13@acm.org<br>Logistics Chair<br>Barbara Morris, UMBC, USA<br>lc-assets13@acm.org<br>Accessibility Chair/ Captioning Competition Chair<br>Raja Kushalnagar, Rochester Institute of Technology, USA & Amanda Stent, ATT, USA<br>access-assets13@acm.org<br>Web Chair<br>Tiago Guerreiro, University of Lisbon, Portugal<br>web-assets13@acm.org<br>Student Volunteers Chair<br>Shiri Azenkot, University of Washington, USA<br>sv-assets13@acm.org<br>Publicity Chair<br>Dianne Pawluk, Virginia Commonwealth University, USA<br>pub-assets13@acm.org<br>

 - Automation of Software Test  
The 5th International Workshop on Automation of Software Test
May 3, 2010 - May 4, 2010
Cape Town, South Africa
Jan 20, 2010
%%
In software development practice, testing accounts for as much as 50% of the total development effort. It is therefore imperative to reduce the cost and improve the effectiveness of software testing by automating the testing process. In the past decades, a great amount of research effort has been spent on automatic test case generation, automatic test oracles, etc. Test automation is also becoming an important part of software testing practice.<br><br>The workshop is the successor of the first four AST workshops held at ICSE 2006-2009. It will provide researchers and practitioners a forum for exchanging ideas, experiences, understanding of the problems, visions for the future, and promising solutions to the problems. The workshop will also provide a platform for researchers and developers of testing tools to work together to identify the problems in the theory and practice of software test automation and to set an agenda and lay the foundation for future development. <br><br>========================================================================================<br>TOPICS OF INTEREST<br>========================================================================================<br>The workshop focuses on bridging the gap between the theories and practice of software test automation. The topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:<br><br>1) Methodology: Software test automation in the context of various software development methodologies, such as in model-driven, component-based, agile, test-driven, product lines, service-oriented, agent-oriented, and aspect-oriented methodologies, and in evolutionary development. <br><br>2) Technology: Automation of test techniques and methods used in test-related activities, support for software testing methods, and applications to specific types of software in different application domains. <br><br>3) Software testing tools and environments: Issues in the development, operation, maintenance and evolution of software testing tools and environments. <br><br>4) Experiments, empirical studies and experience reports and vision of the future of software test automation. <br><br>This year, the charette discussion focuses on Integration Testing and submissions on this topic are especially encouraged, but papers on other topics are also welcome.<br><br><br>========================================================================================<br>CHARETTE DISCUSSION: Integration Testing <br>========================================================================================<br>The workshop continues the successful charette discussions of the previous year focusing on Integration Testing. Integration Testing aims to verify that the various components of a system work together, especially confirm that all interfaces between those components have been correctly implemented. Integration testing applies to the individual integration steps at different system levels.<br><br>The charette discussion sessions planned shall identify the key aspects of integration testing in the software testing automation that worth research efforts in the near future, to envision the approaches to address these aspects, and to form collaborations in order to solve the identified problems more effectively. <br><br><br>========================================================================================<br>INDUSTRIAL CASE STUDIES  <br>========================================================================================<br>There will also be an “Industrial Case Studies” session at the workshop, with shorter presentations reporting the real state of the practice in automation of software testing. Test practitioners who are especially encouraged to contribute their experiences and insights on test automation in this session. Submissions to this session do not have to conform to the main theme of the workshop.<br><br>Topics for this session include, but are not limited to, the following: new tools, new best practices, process innovations related to test automation, gaps in existing vendor toolsets, ideas and visions for near-term research work.<br><br><br>========================================================================================<br>POSTER SESSION <br>========================================================================================<br>Another novelty this year will be the poster session. The poster session shall improve interactions and help the networking among attendees. This enables the opportunity to engage in a much more detailed discussion of your research, the methodology and your findings than in a panel session. <br><br>========================================================================================<br>SUBMISSIONS<br>========================================================================================<br>Three types of submissions are invited: regular papers, case study papers, and case study presentations. <br><br>Regular papers report research and/or practical experience in the area of software test automation. Both long (8-page) and short (4-page) papers are welcomed.<br>Submissions in the case study category may be either a short paper (no more than 4 pages) or a slide presentation (no more than 15 slides). Case study papers and presentations must report on practical applications of test automation. <br><br>All papers submitted to the workshop must be unpublished original work and must not have been submitted anywhere else for publication. The paper submissions must be in English and conform to the ACM SIG conference proceedings format. Presentations must be printed two slides per page and posters must no larger than DIN A0 format. All submissions must be submitted in either PDF or postscript format through online upload to the workshop paper submission website. <br><br>All submissions will be reviewed by three PC members, but using different criteria. Regular papers will be judged on the basis of their clarity, relevance, originality, and contribution. Case study papers and presentations as well as posters will be judged on the basis of their clarity, relevance, and interest to the workshop participants.<br><br><br>========================================================================================<br>PUBLICATION OF PAPERS<br>========================================================================================<br>The accepted workshop papers including both regular and case study papers will be published in the ICSE 2010 Conference Proceedings Volume II in ACM Digital Library. Workshop attendees will receive a memory stick with both proceedings volumes on it. Slide presentations and posters will be published on the AST 2010 website.<br><br>Authors of accepted papers and posters are required to register for the workshop and present the paper at the workshop in order for the paper to be included in the proceedings and ACM Digital Libraries. <br><br><br><br>========================================================================================<br>ORGANIZER<br>========================================================================================<br>Workshop Co-Chairs:<br><br>Prof. Wing Kwong Chan<br>City University of Hong Kong<br>Tat Chee Avenue, Hong Kong<br>wkchan@cs.cityu.edu.hk<br><br>Dr. Christof J.

*** Deadline extended - September 21, 2013 ***<br><br><br>CALL FOR PAPERS<br><br>******************************************************************************<br>10th IEEE International Conference on Autonomic and Trusted Computing <br>ATC-2013<br>Sorrento Peninsula, Italy - December 18-21, 2013<br>hosted by Second University of Naples - SUN<br>http://cse.stfx.ca/~atc2013/<br>******************************************************************************<br><br>Computing systems including hardware, software, communication, and networks<br>are growing towards an ever-increasing scale and heterogeneity, becoming<br>overly complex. Such complexity is getting even more critical with the<br>ubiquitous permeation of embedded devices and other pervasive systems. To cope <br>with the growing and ubiquitous complexity, Autonomic Computing (AC) focuses <br>on self-manageable computing and communication systems that exhibit <br>self-awareness, self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing, <br>self-protection and other self-x operations to the maximum extent possible <br>without human intervention or guidance. Organic Computing (OC) additionally <br>addresses adaptivity, robustness, and controlled emergence as well as <br>nature-inspired concepts for self-organization.<br><br>Any autonomic or organic system must be trustworthy to avoid the risk of <br>losing control and retain confidence that the system will not fail. Trust <br>and/or distrust relationships in the Internet and in pervasive infrastructures <br>are key factors to enable dynamic interaction and cooperation of various <br>users, systems, and services. Trusted/Trustworthy Computing (TC) aims at <br>making computing and communication systems as well as services available, <br>predictable, traceable, controllable, assessable, sustainable, dependable, <br>persistent, security/privacy protectable, etc.<br><br>A series of grand challenges exists to achieve practical autonomic or organic <br>systems with truly trustworthy services. Started in 2005, the series of ATC <br>conferences has been held at Nagasaki, Vienna, Three Gorges (China), Hong <br>Kong, Oslo, Brisbane, Xian, Banff, and Fukuoka. ATC 2013 will include a highly <br>selective program of technical papers, accompanied by workshops, panel <br>discussions and keynote speeches. Established as a premier venue in the area <br>of autonomic and trusted computing, ATC 2013 will offer a forum for <br>researchers to exchange ideas and experiences in the most innovative research <br>and development in these challenging areas and includes all technical aspects <br>related to autonomic/organic computing (AC/OC) and trusted computing (TC). <br><br>Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br>1-  AC/OC Theory and Models<br>    Models, negotiation, cooperation, competition, self-organization,<br>    emergence, verification, etc.<br>2-  AC/OC Architectures and Systems<br>    Autonomic elements & their relationship, frameworks, middleware, <br>    observer/controller architectures, institutional architectures, etc.<br>3-  AC/OC Components and Modules<br>    Multi-core CPU, memory, storage, database, device, server, proxy, <br>    software, OS, I/O, etc.<br>4-  AC/OC Communication and Services<br>    Networks, self-organized net, web service, P2P, grid, EaaS, <br>    IaaS, SaaS, PaaS, cloud computing, etc.<br>5-  AC/OC Tools and Interfaces<br>    Tools/interfaces for AC/OC system development, test, monitoring,<br>    assessment, supervision, etc.<br>6-  Trust Models and Specifications<br>    Models and semantics of trust, distrust, mistrust, over-trust, cheat, <br>    risk, reputation, reliability, etc.<br>7-  Trust-related Security and Privacy<br>    Trust-related secure architecture, framework, policy, intrusion<br>    detection/awareness, protocols, trust-adaptive agents and communities, <br>    data protection, users privacy, access privacy, etc.<br>8-  Trusted Reliable and Dependable Systems<br>    Fault-tolerant systems, hardware redundancy, robustness, survivable<br>    systems, failure recovery, etc.<br>9-  Trustworthy Services and Applications<br>    Trustworthy Internet/web/P2P/grid/cloud services, secure mobile services,<br>    secure wireless services, novel applications, etc.<br>10- Trust Standards and Non-Technical Issues<br>    Trust standards and issues related to personality, ethics, sociology,<br>    culture, psychology, economy, legal aspects, social networking etc.<br><br><br>WORKSHOPS<br>The ATC 2013 Organizing Committee invites proposals for workshops affiliated <br>with the conference and addressing research areas related to the conference. <br>Accepted workshop papers will be included in the proceedings published by <br>IEEE CPS Press.

Since AusDM'02 the conference has showcased research in data mining, providing a forum for presenting and discussing the latest research and developments. Since 2006, all proceedings have been printed as volumes in the CRPIT series.<br><br>This year's conference, AusDM'13, co-hosted with the Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML, http://acml2013.conference.nicta.com.au/), builds on this tradition of facilitating the cross-disciplinary exchange of ideas, experience and potential research directions. Specifically, the conference seeks to showcase: Industry Case Studies; Research Prototypes; Practical Analytics Technology; and Research Student Projects. AusDM'13 will be a meeting place for pushing forward the frontiers of data mining in industry and academia.<br><br><br>Publication and topics<br>======================<br><br>We are calling for papers, both research and applications, and from both academia and industry, for presentation at the conference. All papers will go through double-blind, peer-review by a panel of international experts. Accepted papers will be published in an up-coming volume (Data Mining and Analytics 2013) of the Conferences in Research and Practice in Information Technology (CRPIT) series by the Australian Computer Society which is also held in full-text on the ACM Digital Library and will also be distributed at the conference. For more details on CRPIT please see http://www.crpit.com. Please note that we require that at least one author for each accepted paper will register for the conference and present their work. Selected papers will be invited to extend to publish in Journal of Research and Practice in Information Technology (http://www.jrpit.com).<br><br>AusDM invites contributions addressing current research in data mining and knowledge discovery as well as experiences, novel applications and future challenges.

AutomotiveUI, the International Conference on Automotive User Interfaces and Interactive Vehicular Applications, is the premier forum for UI research in the automotive domain. AutomotiveUI brings together researchers and practitioners interested in both the technical and the human aspects of in-vehicle user interfaces and applications. AutomotiveUI '13 will investigate novel in-vehicle services, issues related to driver distraction, approaches to improving driver performance, and the varying needs of different user groups.<br><br>In-car interactive technology is becoming ubiquitous and cars are increasingly connected to the outside world. Drivers and passengers use this technology because it provides valuable services. Some technology, such as collision warning systems, assists drivers in performing their primary in-vehicle task (driving). Other technology provides information on myriad subjects or offers entertainment to the driver and passengers.<br><br>The design of in-car devices has historically been the responsibility of car manufacturers and their parts suppliers. However, the responsibility is now shifting toward larger and more fluctuating groups including car OEMs, Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers of factory-installed electronics, and the manufacturers of hardware and software brought into the vehicle (e.g., personal navigation devices, smartphones, and tablets).<br><br>The challenge that arises from the proliferation of in-car devices is that they may distract drivers from the primary task of driving, with possibly disastrous results. Thus, one of the major goals of this conference is to explore ways in which in-car user interfaces can be designed so as to lessen driver distraction while still enabling valuable services.<br><br>Consider driving safety, our focus in designing in-car user interfaces should not be purely on eliminating distractions. In-car user interfaces also offer the opportunity to improve the driver's performance (e.g, increasing awareness of upcoming hazards).<br><br>In-car interfaces can also enhance the experience of all occupants in the car. To this end, a further goal of AutomotiveUI ’13 is the exploration of in-car interfaces that address the varying needs of different users (including disabled drivers, elderly drivers, passengers, and the users of rear-seat entertainment systems). The conference goal is to showcase ways to advance the state of the art in vehicular user experiences, for enhanced safety, comfort, and enjoyment.

*****  AUTONOMICS 2008 *****<br>2nd International Conference on Autonomic Computing and Communication Systems<br>http://www.autonomics.eu/<br>September 23-25, 2008, Turin, Italy<br><br>In recent years, a plethora of electronic devices embedded into everyday objects and able to interface with the surrounding environment have emerged, foreshadowing the deployment of pervasive context-aware services. Similar to the Internet, these trends will revolutionize existing paradigms of communication, networking, and computing. In particular, the complexity hidden in such dynamic large-scale networks and services calls for self-management and autonomicity as a necessary condition for obtaining purposeful systems. <br>The challenges posed by such a vision cover a wide range of disciplines and sciences, including computing, communication, distributed systems, and control systems. Further, these challenges call for a new, integrated and multidisciplinary approach to pervasive computing and communication environments, giving rise to a new converged science, able to work at the junction of systems, computing and communication sciences. The Autonomics conference provides an international forum driving the emergent science of autonomic systems, bringing together research communities in communication and computing, promoting cross-fertilization among the different disciplines involved.<br><br>Scope: The primary research challenges faced are the communication, design, programming, deployment, use, and fundamental limits of autonomic, pervasive, context-aware systems running on top of dynamic, possibly large-scale, distributed systems. Authors are invited to submit papers to Autonomics 2008 reporting on original research related to the design, implementation, analysis, evaluation, and deployment of autonomic systems. The conference intends to attract attendees with diverse backgrounds. We solicit papers in autonomic, pervasive, and context-aware systems. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br><br>- Theoretical foundations of autonomic systems<br>- Models and metrics <br>- Energy-efficient algorithms <br>- Programming paradigms<br>- Middleware for pervasive systems <br>- Software architectures and toolkits <br>- Positioning and tracking technologies <br>- Architectures & algorithms for self-* systems<br>- Privacy, security, dynamic trust and social issues<br>- Location- and context-awareness<br>- Tools, languages and platforms<br>- Applications and systems<br>- Resource, network and service (self) management<br>- Enabling technologies for pervasive environments<br><br>Submissions will be judged on originality, significance, interest, clarity, relevance, and correctness.<br>____________________________________________________________________________________________<br>IMPORTANT DATES<br>Full paper due:                June 8, 2008<br>Notification of acceptance:    July 10, 2008<br>Final version due:             August 15, 2008<br><br>Submission Instructions<br>Authors are invited to submit full papers of up to 10 pages in ACM conference proceedings format through Easychair ")http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=autonomics2008).<br>The proceedings will be an ICST publication and the papers will be listed in the ACM digital library and indexed by EI.<br>_____________________________________________________________________________________________<br><br>ORGANIZING COMMITTEE<br><br>General Chair:<br>A.

During the last decades, growing interest has been aroused in exploiting electrical nature of the human nervous system for neural human-machine interfacing, using EEG, ECG, EMG, EOG, GSR, etc. In addition to the autonomic nervous signals, researchers employ extrinsic physiological channels including speech, facial expression, and gesture to approach affective human-machine interfaces. Some of these modalities can be successfully combined for human-like decision-making. A fascinating fact is that such physiological measurements can also offer great potential for daily healthcare monitoring. Moreover, recently the medical mainstream recognizes the health/healing power of various environmental elements including social activity, diet and nutrition, joy and stress, family, and lifestyle. All of these aspects extend the scope of applying physiological signals to multi-disciplinary research fields. The aim of this workshop is to assemble researchers from diverse backgrounds together to discuss their ideas and solutions and to build a new vision.

The goal of biomedical and health informatics is to advance biomedicine and healthcare using information technologies. One of fundamental issues that healthcare/biomedical researchers encounter today is how to make use of the enormous amount of electronic healthcare/biomedical data. Healthcare knowledge discovery from the data holds great promise to improve the quality of patient care, prevent potential medical errors, and reduce healthcare cost. In addition, this may enable the practices of medicine to be (healthcare) data-driven and accelerate evidence-based medicine. Establishing a methodology for knowledge discovery and management of large amounts of health/biomedical data has therefore become a main priority in health informatics and biomedicine. To accomplish this objective, both practical applications and theoretical research will be essential.<br><br> <br><br>Organized in conjunction with BIBM 2012, the goal of this workshop is to attract various researchers from both computer science, information science, biomedical informatics, biomedicine, and healthcare for sharing and exchanging their awareness of current research issues, technologies, and ideas.

With the development of Molecular Biology during the last decades, we are witnessing an exponential growth of both the volume and the complexity of biological data. For example, the Human Genome Project provided the sequence of the 3 billion DNA bases that constitute the human genome. And, consequently, we are provided too with the sequences of about 100,000 proteins. Therefore, we are entering the post-genomic era: after having focused so many efforts on the accumulation of data, we have now to focus as much effort, and even more, on the analysis of these data. Analyzing this huge volume of data is a challenging task because, not only, of its complexity and its multiple and numerous correlated factors, but also, because of the continuous evolution of our understanding of the biological mechanisms. Classical approaches of biological data analysis are no longer efficient and produce only a very limited amount of information, compared to the numerous and complex biological mechanisms under study. From here comes the necessity to use computer tools and develop new in silico high performance approaches to support us in the analysis of biological data and, hence, to help us in our understanding of the correlations that exist between, on one hand, structures and functional patterns of biological sequences and, on the other hand, genetic and biochemical mechanisms. Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD) are a response to these new trends. <br><br>Topics of BIOKDD'13 workshop include, but not limited to:<br><br>Data Preprocessing: Biological Data Storage, Representation and Management (data warehouses, databases, sequences, trees, graphs, biological networks and pathways, …), Biological Data Cleaning (errors removal, redundant data removal, completion of missing data, …), Feature Extraction (motifs, subgraphs, …), Feature Selection (filter approaches, wrapper approaches, hybrid approaches, embedded approaches, …)<br><br>Data Mining: Biological Data Regression (regression of biological sequences…), Biological data clustering/biclustering (microarray data biclustering, clustering/biclustering of biological sequences, …), Biological Data Classification (classification of biological sequences…), Association Rules Learning from Biological Data, Text mining and Application to Biological Sequences, Web mining and Application to Biological Data, Parallel, Cloud and Grid Computing for Biological Data Mining<br><br>Data Postprocessing: Biological Nuggets of Knowledge Filtering, Biological Nuggets of Knowledge Representation and Visualization, Biological Nuggets of Knowledge Evaluation (calculation of the classification error rate, evaluation of the association rules via numerical indicators, e.g. measurements of interest, … ), Biological Nuggets of Knowledge Integration <br><br>PAPER SUBMISSION DETAILS: <br>Authors are invited to submit electronically original contributions in English. Submitted papers should not exceed 5 pages in IEEE format http://www.computer.org/portal/web/cscps/formatting.

Growing interests on trustworthiness of authentication stimulate employment of biometric techniques. Nowadays, biometric applications can be found in diverse areas such as health monitoring, national ID cards, e-banking, e-commerce, etc. It rises to challenges of robustness, reliability, interoperability, scalability, system reliability and usability. Large-scale applications such as the European Union Visa Information System (VIS) and Unique Identification (UID) in India require high accuracy. Multimodal biometrics combined with fusion techniques can improve recognition performance. Efficient searching or indexing methods can accelerate identi-fication efficiency. Additionally, quality of acquired biometric samples can strongly influence the performance. Quality as-sessment methods cannot only guarantee success of authenti-cation but can also provide helpful feedback to system opera-tors during the capturing process. Recently it was shown, that biometric recognition with low cost sensors embedded in mobile devices such as cell phones can improve deployment and acceptance of biometric systems.<br>Moreover, concerns about security and privacy cannot be neglected. The relevant techniques in the area of presentation attack detection (liveness detection) and template protection are about to supplement biometric systems, in order to improve fake resistance, prevent potential attacks such as cross matching, identity theft etc. <br><br>The BIOSIG 2013 conference addresses these issues and will present innovations and best practices that can be transferred into future applications. We invite stakeholders and technical experts to submit original research papers. Industrial contributions presenting lessons learned from practical usage, case study, recent results of prototypes, are also welcomed. Submissions should be full papers (max. 12 pages) in English.

CALL FOR PAPERS<br>			  BIRTE 2013<br>		Seventh International Workshop on<br>		Real-Time Business Intelligence<br>		 http://birte2013.cs.aau.dk/<br>			 August 26, 2013  (TENTATIVE)<br>		In conjunction with VLDB 2013<br>	     August 26-30, 2013 Trento, Italy<br>			<br><br>			<br>IMPORTANT DATES<br><br>* Abstracts due: May 29, 2013 <br>* Papers due: June 2, 2013 	<br>* Notification: July 8, 2013<br>* Camera-ready copies: August 5, 2013<br><br><br>DESCRIPTION<br><br>In today's competitive and highly dynamic environment, analyzing data to understand how the business is performing and to predict outcomes and trends has become critical. The traditional approach to reporting is no longer adequate. Instead users now demand easy-to-use intelligent platforms and applications capable of analyzing real-time data to provide insight and actionable information at the right time. The end goal is to support better and timelier decision making, enabled by the availability of up-to-date, high quality information.<br><br>Although there has been progress in this direction and many companies are introducing products towards meeting this goal, there is still a long way to go. In particular, the whole lifecycle of business intelligence requires innovative techniques and methodologies capable of dealing with the requirements imposed by these new generation of BI applications. From the capture of real-time business data to the transformation and delivery of actionable information, all the stages of the Business Intelligence (BI) cycle call for new algorithms and paradigms to support value-added functionalities. These functionalities include dynamic integration of real-time data feeds from operational sources, optimization and evolution of ETL transformations and analytical models, and dynamic generation of adaptive real-time dashboards, just to name a few.<br><br>The series of BIRTE workshops, starting in 2006, have always been held in conjunction with VLDB. The series aims to provide a forum to discuss topics related to this emerging field and set research directions towards making business intelligence more real-time. Following the success of previous BIRTE editions (2006, 2008-2012) submissions for research, industrial and position papers on relevant topics are encouraged. <br><br>TOPICS OF INTEREST<br><br>Areas of particular interest for the workshop include (but are not limited to) the following, <br>as THEY RELATE TO REAL-TIME BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE:<br><br>-	Analytics as a service<br>-	Analytics for Linked Data/semantic web <br>-	Big Data systems and applications for high velocity data<br>-	Case studies and experience (lessons, pitfalls, guidelines) from real-time BI practice<br>-	Challenges from advanced domains, e.g., energy data or sensor data<br>-	Cloud intelligence <br>-	Collaborative real-time BI<br>-	Crowdsourcing and crowd intelligence<br>-	Data capture in real-time<br>-	Data mining, analytics, and OLAP for real-time decision support<br>-	Data quality and cleansing<br>-	Event-driven analytics<br>-	Integration of prediction models with real-time and historical data<br>-	Integration of open and private data <br>-	Linking business strategies with real-time BI<br>-	Novel architectures for real-time BI<br>-	Optimization, performance and scalability<br>-	Privacy and security in real-time BI<br>-	Real-time ETL, ELT, and beyond <br>-	Streaming data<br>-	Tuning and management of the real-time data warehouse <br>- 	Visualizing real-time data and information<br><br>Papers describing real-time BI systems, platforms, and applications are especially welcome and may be allocated extra time for demoing (if appropriate). <br>For the first time, this year we also accept demo paper submissions.<br><br>SUBMISSION GUIDELINES<br><br>Papers should follow the LNCS format (see http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-791344-0l for details).

Places that were previously spaces for conversations are now converted to workplaces. Even at scientific conferences it is hard to spot an active worker without a supporting device. This fact has significant implications for business applications. Companies need to acknowledge that employees as well as clients access those applications using mobile devices. What works in a monolithic environment under control of the enterprise may not work in a mobile environment. Therefore, classical topics like business processes or information management has to be rethought.<br>It is our pleasure to invite you to submit your work to BIS2013 conference. The BIS conference is a well-respected event joining international researchers to discuss the wide range of the development, implementation, application and improvement of business applications and systems.

BMSD 2013: Extended submission deadline to 31 March 2013 (hard deadline) <br><br>CALL FOR PAPERS<br><br>===========================================================================<br>3rd International Symposium on Business Modeling and Software Design (BMSD 2013)<br>URL: http://www.is-bmsd.org<br>Submission: sending a PDF file to secretariat@iicrest.org by March-14<br><br><br>July 8 - 10, 2013<br>Noordwijkerhout, The Netherlands<br><br><br>Held in conjunction with:<br>7th International Symposium on e-Health Services and Technologies (EHST 2013)<br>URL: http://www.is-ehst.org<br><br>Organized by: IICREST<br>In Cooperation with: CTIT, AUTH, TU Sofia<br>Symposium Hotel: NH Conference Centre Leeuwenhorst hotel<br>===========================================================================<br><br><br>==================<br> IMPORTANT DATES:<br>==================<br>  Paper Submission: March 14, 2013<br>  Authors Notification: April 15, 2013<br>  Final Paper Submission and Registration: April 29, 2013<br><br><br>==================<br> SYMPOSIUM SCOPE:<br>==================<br>BMSD is a leading international forum that brings together researchers and practitioners interested in business modeling and its relation to software design. Particular areas of interest are: (i) Business Models and Requirements; (ii) Business Models and Services; (iii) Business Models and Software; (iv) Information Systems Architectures. Each year, a special theme is chosen, for making presentations and discussions more focused. The theme of BMSD 2013 is: ENTERPRISE ENGINEERING AND SOFTWARE GENERATION.<br> Adequate business models are of huge importance not only for understanding and (re-)engineering an organization but also for automating (part of) its processes by means of software systems. Not grasping correctly and exhaustively a business system would inevitably lead to consequent software failures. It is therefore claimed that software generation should essentially have its roots in corresponding enterprise engineering models.<br> <br><br>===================<br> TOPICS OF INTEREST:<br>===================<br>BUSINESS MODELS AND REQUIREMENTS <br>- Business Analysis - Value Models and Process Models<br> - Essential Business Models<br> - Re-usable Business Models<br> - Relating Business Goals to Requirements<br> - Business Process Coordination<br> - Business Entities and Business Roles<br> - Business Data and Semantics<br> - Business Rules<br> - Behavior Modeling and Pragmatics<br> - Identification and Elicitation of Requirements<br> - Domain-imposed and User-defined Requirements<br> - Requirements Analysis<br> <br>BUSINESS MODELS AND SERVICES<br> - Business Modeling and Service Science<br> - Relating Business Goals to the Identification of Services<br> - Service Modeling - Technology-independent and Platform-specific<br> - Business Rules and Service Composition<br> - Autonomic Service Behavior<br> - Context-aware Service Behavior<br> - Re-usable Service Models<br> <br>BUSINESS MODELS AND SOFTWARE<br> - Business Modeling -driven Derivation of Software<br> - Business Innovation and Software Evolution<br> - Business-IT Alignment and Traceability<br> - Re-usable Business Models and Software Components<br> - Business Rules and Software Specification<br> - Business Goals and Software Integration<br> - Autonomic and Context-aware Business/Software Systems<br> - Affective Computing and User-aware Software Systems<br> <br>INFORMATION SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURES<br> - Enterprise Architectures<br> - Service-Oriented Architectures<br> - Architectural Styles<br> - Architectural Viewpoints<br> - Crosscutting Concerns<br><br><br>=================<br> SPECIAL SESSIONS:<br>=================<br>Special Session 1: Embedded Systems and Business Models<br>Special Session 2: Human-Centered Information Systems Modeling<br>Special Session 3: Intelligent Algorithms for Real-Time Information Systems Support<br>Special Session 4: Business Models and Information Systems for Sustainable Development<br><br><br>===================<br> PAPER SUBMISSION:<br>===================<br>Submitted papers will be subject to a double-blind review process.

******************************************************************************<br><br>Call for Research and Industry Papers<br><br>BPM 2014 – 12th International Conference on Business Process Management <br> <br>7-12 September 2014, Haifa, Israel <br><br>http://bpm2014.haifa.ac.il<br><br>******************************************************************************<br><br>The BPM conference is the leading forum for researchers, practitioners, <br>developers and users in the field of Business Process Management (BPM) <br>to explore and exchange knowledge on BPM. The conference covers all <br>aspects of BPM, including theory, models, techniques, architectures, <br>systems, and empirical studies, and engages the most renowned <br>representatives of the BPM community worldwide in talks, tutorials, and <br>scientific discussions. <br><br>Given the increasing span of BPM, this year the conference is opening up <br>to a number of new topics such as business process improvement, studies <br>relating to business process quality, BPM education and training and <br>process data analytics and visualization. These new topics add to <br>existing areas of interest and relevance to BPM research and industry. <br>The conference particularly reaches out to emerging fields of research, <br>industrial practice, and applications. Recognizing the interdisciplinary <br>nature of BPM, the conference also encourages submissions that embrace <br>other disciplines such as Information Systems and IT Management, Data <br>and Knowledge Management, Web/Software Engineering, Service-Oriented <br>Computing, Social Computing, Cloud Computing, and many more. <br><br>Besides regular research papers, authors may submit industry papers, <br>clearly marked as such. An industry paper reports work from within a <br>context of BPM practice, typically studying requirements imposed by <br>current practice, identifying new problems, or reporting experience on <br>the deployment of methods, solutions, tools or systems in practice. <br>Industry submissions undergo the same review process as regular research <br>papers and are requested to meet the same high quality standards for <br>originality, clarity of the contribution, and relevance to the <br>community. However the review of an industry paper puts more emphasis to <br>the value of new insights into current practice and less emphasis to the <br>technical depth and scientific methodology compared to regular research <br>papers. <br><br>BPM 2014 will take place in Haifa, Israel’s beautiful seaport on the <br>Mediterranean. Haifa is situated on the Carmel Mountain, overlooking the <br>Haifa bay and the mountains of Galilee, and has panoramic views as well <br>as beautiful sandy beaches. Haifa is also an industrial center, housing <br>the R&D labs of international corporations. Israel's rich history and <br>cultural heritage attracts millions of tourists each year, with sacred <br>places to three religions. Some of these sites, such as Nazareth and the <br>Sea of Galilee, are in the vicinity of Haifa. <br><br>############################<br>Topics<br>############################<br><br>As in previous editions, BPM 2014 will feature a varied set of <br>BPM-related workshops and co-located events. <br><br>The topics for both research and industry papers are listed below. Each <br>major topic is championed by two senior PC members, who will promote the <br>topic and lead review processes in BPM2014. <br><br>Human-centric BPM<br>Topic champions: Jan Mendling and Hajo Reijers<br>   * People-intensive processes<br>   * Crowdsourcing processes<br>   * Social business processes<br>   * User-centric aspects of process management and use<br>   * Integrating strategy, processes, people and IT<br>   * Globally distributed process management<br><br>Management issues and empirical studies<br>Topic champions: Hajo Reijers and Michael zur Muehlen<br>   * Business process lifecycle management<br>   * Relationship between business strategy and business process<br>   * Success factors and measures in BPM<br>   * Business process improvement<br>   * BPM governance and compliance management<br>   * BPM maturity<br>   * Adoption and Practice of BPM<br>   * Case Studies and Experience Reports<br>   * BPM Education and Training<br><br>Management of process execution data<br>Topic champions: Wil van der Aalst and Stephanie Rinderle-ma<br>   * Process tracing and monitoring<br>   * Process performance measurement<br>   * Process mining<br>   * Process data warehousing<br>   * Data streaming in business processes<br>   * Process data analytics and visualization<br><br>Non-traditional BPM scenarios<br>Topic champions: Manfred Reichert and Richard Hull<br>   * Knowledge-intensive processes<br>   * Data-driven processes<br>   * Distributed and mobile processes<br>   * Inter-process planning and coordination<br>   * Grid and scientific workflows<br><br>Process architectures and platforms<br>Topic champions: Avigdor Gal and Remco Dijkman<br>   * Process-oriented software architectures<br>   * Service-oriented architectures for BPM<br>   * Workflow management systems<br>   * Security aspects of business process execution<br>   * Automated planning for business process execution<br>   * Resource management in business process execution<br>   * Process componentization and component repositories<br><br>Process flexibility and evolution<br>Topic champions: Barbara Weber and Richard Hull<br>   * Process exception handling<br>   * Adaptive and context-aware processes<br>   * Case handling<br>   * Process-enhanced groupware<br>   * Process change management<br>   * Monitoring and provenance across change<br><br>Process modeling and theory<br>Topic champions: Oscar Pastor and Karsten Wolf<br>   * Foundations of business process models<br>   * Process modeling languages, notations and methods<br>   * Reference process models<br>   * Process patterns and standards<br>   * Artifact-centric business processes<br>   * Loosely structured business processes<br>   * Automated process composition and synthesis<br>   * Process metadata and semantic reasoning<br>   * Variability and configuration of process models<br>   * Process simulation and static analysis<br>   * Business process quality <br><br>Process model management<br>Topic champions: Remco Dijkman and Jan Mendling<br>   * Process model storage<br>   * Process model repositories<br>   * Process model indexing<br>   * Process model retrieval<br>   * Process model similarity<br>   * Process model transformations<br><br>############################<br>Submission Instructions <br>############################<br><br>Papers should be formatted according to Springer’s LNCS formatting <br>guidelines (for instructions and style sheets see <br>http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html).

The topics addressed by the BPMDS series are focused on business processes and their IT support. . This is one of the keystones of Information Systems theory, and a topic that any major conference in the area of Information Systems needs to address, independently of the current fashion. The continued interest in this topic on behalf of the IS community is reflected by the success of the past BPMDS events, and their promotion from a workshop to a working conference.<br><br>The BPMDS series has produced thirteen events from 1998 to 2012. From 2011, BPMDS has become a two-day working conference attached to CAiSE (Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering). The basic principles of the BPMDS series:<br><br>1. BPMDS serves as a meeting place for researchers and practitioners in the areas of business development, and business applications (software) development<br>2. The aim of the event is mainly discussions, rather than presentations.<br>3. Each event has a theme that is mandatory for idea papers.<br>4. Each event's results are, usually, published in a special issue of an international journal.<br><br>The goals, format, and history of BPMDS can be found on the web site: http://www.bpmds.org/history

1st International Workshop on Business Processes Security<br>BPS '09<br>	<br><br>In conjunction with DEXA 2009<br><br>August 31- September 4, 2009<br><br>University of Linz, Austria<br><br>As business-process automation started to take hold in the early 1990s, organizations began to replace people with mainframe applications and EDI transfers to perform mundane tasks including data entry and processing. However, for crucial business processes such as wire transfers, customer database queries, supply chain management and purchase orders, organizations continued to use human intervention, believing that auditor supervision was required to ensure accurate money transfers and appropriate access controls to sensitive information.<br>Today, no division of labor exists between the tasks for which applications and people are responsible. Conversely, human auditors and applications work together in concert to manage business processes and the Web servers, databases, and middleware on which they depend. However, many of these applications, especially Web-based ones, are rife with vulnerabilities, ranging from SQL injection to cross-site scripting. Even the Service Oriented Architectures they run on are far more vulnerable than their predecessors—mainframes and leased-line transfers. As a result, although SOA-based applications help expedite business processes, they at the same time expose organizations to a considerable amount of security risk. <br>Ensuring the secure functioning of SOAs and, by extension, the business processes they support, has become crucial to an enterprise’s success and managing application vulnerabilities has thereby grown vastly in importance. <br>The workshop on Business Processes Security  invites the submission of papers.<br>Researchers and practitioners are encouraged to submit papers on all aspects of security and privacy concerning business processes including management processes, operational processes and supporting processes. <br>Paper submissions can be either research papers, or  industry reports. Submissions from companies, practitioners and vendors are encouraged. <br>     <br>Suggested Topics<br>BPS 2009 invites research submissions on all topics related to all aspects of security and privacy concerning business processes, but are not limited to those listed below:<br> <br><br>    * Secure computation paradigms for business processes<br>    * SOA Security<br>    * Business Process dependability<br>    * Business process privacy and access control<br>    * Controlled information sharing in business coalitions<br>    * Secure computation paradigms for business processes<br><br> <br><br>IMPORTANT DATES<br><br>    * Submission of full papers: February 28, 2009<br>    * Notification of acceptance: May 1, 2009 <br>    * Camera-ready copies due: May 31, 2009<br><br><br>Conference Chairpersons<br><br>    * Ernesto Damiani, University of Milan, Italy<br>    * Florian Kerschbaum, SAP, Germany<br>    * Stefania Marrara, University of Milan, Italy<br><br><br>Program Committee<br><br>    * Paolo Ceravolo, University of Milan, Italy<br>    * Octavian Catrina, International University in Germany<br>    * Stelvio Cimato, University of Milan, Italy<br>    * Angelo Corallo, EBMS University of Lecce, Italy<br>    * Fulvio Frati, University of Milan, Italy<br>    * Cristiano Fugazza, University of Milan, Italy<br>    * Gabriele Gianini, University of Milan, Italy<br>    * Sebastiaan de Hoogh, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Netherlands<br>    * Fernando Liesa, Zaragoza Logistics Center, Spain<br>    * Richard Pibernik, European Business School International University, Germany<br>    * Amitabh Saxena, International University in Germany<br>    * Berry Schoemakers, Technische Universiteit Eindhoven, Netherlands<br>    * Olga Scotti, University of Milan, Italy<br>    * Davide Storelli, EBMS University of Lecce, Italy<br>    * Lotz Volkmar, SAP AG, Germany <br>    * Antonio Zilli, EBMS University of Lecce, Italy<br><br><br>Paper Submission Details<br>   <br>Authors are invited to submit original research contributions or experience reports in English. <br><br>    * The submitted manuscript should closely reflect the final paper as it will appear in the Proceedings.<br>    * Papers should not exceed 5 pages in IEEE format (http://www.computer.org/portal/site/cscps/index.jsp).<br>    * Any submission that exceeds length limits or deviates from formatting requirements may be rejected without review.<br><br>For paper registration and electronic submission see DEXA website.<br>Submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition.

Communication networks of today are going through a rapid evolution. Different kinds of networks with different characteristics are emerging and they are integrating in heterogeneous networks. For these reasons, there are many interconnection problems which may occur at different levels in the hardware and software design of communicating entities and communication networks. These kinds of networks need to manage an increasing usage demand, provide support for a significant number of services, guarantee their QoS, and optimize the utilization of network resources. Therefore, architectures and algorithms in these networks become very complex and it seems imperative to focus on new models and methods as well as mechanisms, which can enable the network to perform adaptive behaviors.<br><br>The success of all-IP networking and wireless technology has changed the ways of living for the people around the world. The progress of electronic integration and wireless communications is going to pave the way to offer people the access to the wireless networks on the fly, based on which all electronic devices will be able to exchange the information with each other whenever necessary. Also, ubiquitous computing is an emerging field of research for computing paradigms in the 21st century. This emergence is the natural result of research and technological advances mainly in wireless communications, mobile computing and agent technologies. Supported by recent technological advances in low power wireless communications along with silicon integration of various functionalities such as sensing, communications, intelligence and actuations, ad-hoc networks and sensor networks are emerging as a critically important disruptive computer class based on a new platform, networking structure and interface that enable novel, low cost, high volume applications such as nuclear, biological and chemical attack detection and protection, home automation, battlefield surveillance and environmental monitoring.

<br><br>Information Systems Engineering in Times of Crisis<br><br>Real-time information systems and overly complex financial products have been blamed as causes of recent financial crises. The IS Engineering community is treating such phenomena as challenges, to be addressed through research and improved practices. In particular, our community has begun to address the role of information systems in predicting, preventing, and reacting to crises of many different kinds: data-centric financial and fiscal dependency analysis of the globalized financial systems, resilience of critical infrastructures by information management, reaction to natural disasters such as fires, floods, earthquakes, etc. Due to the very nature of crises as unexpected events with broad and vast impact, IS Engineering challenges traditional wisdom and methodologies, as well as interactions between research and practice β including stakeholders such as crisis victims.<br><br>CAiSE '14 will, as always, act as a forum of discussion that brings together researchers and practitioners in the field of IS Engineering. It will be the place to share mature research, ground-breaking ideas, and experience reports in our discipline.<br><br>CAiSE welcomes all submissions that fall in the domain of information systems engineering. This year, the conference extends a special welcome to papers that address the role of IS engineering in crisis situations. Four kinds of contributions are accepted: technical papers, empirical evaluation papers, reports of experience, and exploratory papers.
